    "\"The prevalence of fake drugs is a menace to over 200 million people in Nigeria. In this piece, ANOZIE EGOLE looks at the effects of substandard products on the nationƒ??s economyEarlier this year, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, NPHDA, said that over 70 per cent of medicines being dispensed in Nigeria were substandard. The agency noted that the majority of Nigerians did not have access to quality health services.Similarly, officers of the Nigeria Customs Service in collaboration with other sister agencies like the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control recently destroyed 48 containers of substandard drugs coming into the country. This could be said to be a confirmation of what NPHDA had said.A lot of Nigerians have been hard hit by this menace. According to medical experts, some of the health issues ranging from loss of sight and hearing defects as well as kidney and liver issues are caused by substandard drugs or abuse thereof.Nigeria is the most counterfeit market in the developing world, according to Bloomberg, occupying a top seat among African countries losing thousands of citizens annually to fake drugs. About 120,000? ? ? ? Africans die annually, according to Brazzaville Foundation.The negative effects of substandard drugs in Nigeria can only be imagined as peddlers of these products disguise in several forms just to carry on with their illegal business.Most streets in Nigeria have medicine merchants, popularly known as chemists, in various corners dispensing drugs at will ƒ?? even without certification. Some hawk them, while a few have backyard factories where they manufacture these products and dish them to vulnerable Nigerians. These products are attractive to the vast majority of Nigerians because they are relatively cheaper compared to medicines from genuine pharmacies. And with 95 million people poor in Nigeria, according to the World Bank, it is easier to see why the counterfeit market is booming, say experts.Some of these merchants of substandard drugs leave the buyer with no traceable address, making it hard to arrest and prosecute them.The pharmaceutical industry is hard hit by the prevalence of these drugs. Pharmacists complain that a lot of Nigerians now tar everybody in the drug value chain with the same brush. Also, counterfeit drugs are threatening over N500 billion investments made by local pharma players in the country.? Currently, a number of local industries complain of low patronage, resulting from Nigerians finding cheaper alternatives in unapproved medicines.Effects on healthThe National Chairman of the Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria, Wale Oladigbolu, described fake and substandard as a waste of resources.He also said that the prevalence of substandard? drugs in the system had led to distrust in the nationƒ??s health system.ƒ??There is a spectrum for that effect. It ranges from economic effect, social impact and also has health implications. Let me talk about the economic impact of substandard medicines. It is a waste of resources and energy when these drugs circulate within our system. The social impact is that there is a distrust of the health system in Nigeria once the prevalence of fake drugs is on the high rise. ƒ??The most important impact of substandard medicine is that the person who takes the medicines wonƒ??t have the positive effect that he or she desires. So, the goal of taking the medicine will not be achieved.ƒ?Oladigbolu stated that consumption of substandard drugs could lead to other damages in the system.ƒ??Some of the substances that they use in making these falsified medicines are outrightly dangerous to the health and could lead to damages. When people are sick, they go to get well, but when they take substandard medicines they stay longer in hospitals. It can also lead to some other dangerous diseases. Imagine if a drug is to assist a pregnant woman and that drug is substandard. The implication is that there wonƒ??t be safe delivery and there would be surgery. Imagine somebody who is supposed to leave the hospital now but has to go through surgery and all that. So, it is dangerous to the system.ƒ?Also speaking, the Secretary of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Frank Muonemeh, lamented that substandard drugs now competed with the genuine manufacturers in the market.He added that most substandard drugs were being flown or imported into the country. ƒ??Those falsified medicines flow into the country; they are imported. They compete with the originally manufactured medicines and the patient cannot get what he or she wants. The patient will also end up spending more money and you know we make a lot of out of pocket expenses to buy drugs. Almost 70 per cent of Nigerians still spend money out of their pockets because they donƒ??t have health insurance, so youƒ??re gambling.ƒ? Related News Fake drugs: Convict fined, NAFDAC demands stiffer penalty NAFDAC arrests 32-year-old for importing fake drugs PSN seeks measures to checkmate fake drugs The Chief Executive Officer, of Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals Plc, Matthew Azoji, said, ƒ??First of all, the effect of substandard medicines on the health of Nigerians is not only that there would be failure in the treatment ƒ?? some of those substandard? also have the tendency of destroying the health of the individual who is taking them. They may not be able to know what they are taking and at the end of the day, the health of the person is worsened. So, it has the tendency of destroying the health of the individual because they are always cheaper.ƒ?Meanwhile, a Public Health and Infectious Diseases Physician, Dr. Maclawrence Famuyiwa, said, ƒ??The health implications of those substandard? can essentially be said to be poison since their compositions are uncertain and may be at concentrations that are dangerous for human health when consumed. They end up not treating the diseases they are meant to treat. So, they can lead to early death of those using the drugs to treat their diseases and can also result in treatment failure. Also,? those drugs can cause organ damages, for example, kidney failure which will essentially require more money to be spent for the person to survive.ƒ?? Economic effect? Famuyiwa was of the view that substandard drugs could lead to extra expenses. ƒ??The person being treated will end up spending more to achieve a cure because when those substandard fail to work, patients will still have to spend more money again to buy genuine drugs to be able to achieve a cure.ƒ?On his part, Azoji said that by patronising substandard drugs, taxes going to the Federal Government would be reduced.ƒ??Not only are they damaging the health of the individuals, they are taking the market from genuine companies, thereby affecting the economy of the country. The genuine companies that pay taxes and support the employment structure will have their market taken away. If their markets are taken away, their businesses will go down, and the more their businesses go down, the more their contribution to the GDP of the country is reduced significantly.ƒ??And when this happens, the revenue that comes to the government in terms of taxes is reduced and the employment that they generate will reduce.Why counterfeit drugs? Pharmaceutical practitioners believe that the influx of substandard drugs into Nigeria may not go soon due to the low purchasing power of Nigerians.According to the PMGMAN scribe, Muonemeh, ƒ??For me, these things are bound to happen because we know the purchasing power. You are very aware of the current dollar rate, that the purchasing power of people is no more strong.ƒ?He added that local manufacturers were preventing the prices of these drugs from rising.ƒ??Itƒ??s tough for manufacturers. We are the ones holding forth so that prices of products wonƒ??t escalate and the reason we do that is to ensure we do not leave the patient to choose between buying substandard and original medicines So, the same patient is left with the same choice of choosing between the original drug and the substandard medicine.ƒ?ConclusionThe experts opined that the Federal Government must come up with strong policies to ensure that these drugs would not find their ways into the country.According to Oladigbolu, ƒ??All the regulatory authorities have to stand up to these. It is something that the Federal Government has to stand up to, to ensure that we donƒ??t have substandard drugs in our system. These are outrightly dangerous to the health of Nigerians. It means that people will have to spend more and stay longer in the hospitals because the medicines are substandard. It also means that the health industry will be discredited because people will be concerned about the quality of medicine they take. If the medicines are not trusted, then the health system cannot be said to be trusted.ƒ? The ACPN chairman also said that the players? might have lost 25 per cent of revenue to the influx of substandard drugs.ƒ??I canƒ??t really say the amount the sector may be losing. I am a scientist and we donƒ??t quote figures out of context, but the sector may be losing up to 25 per cent of its revenue to the influx of substandard medicines. It means that substandard will be cheaper and people may want to patronise that one over established companiesƒ?? products, which might be slightly more expensive. And when people take such medicines without results, they have to go back to the hospital. As a matter of fact, the National Health Insurance once said there was perceived low quality of medicines in Nigeria.ƒ?\"\n",
    "\"Nigerian manufacturers have slashed their investments by 56 per cent in seven years, reflecting a sector buffeted on all sides by a cacophony of poor policies and economic headwinds.Between 2016 and 2021, manufacturersƒ?? investments tumbled from N489.44 billion to N217.22 billion, according to data collected by the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria but analysed by The PUNCH.ƒ??How many companies in our sector are still in operation? Wempco has shut down; WAHUM is struggling, and the rest are just there. When we come for meetings, we will not be more than 11,ƒ? Chairman of Qualitek Industries, Engineer Oluyinka Kufile, who is a major player in aluminium and steel sector, told The PUNCH.Kufile attributed the situation to a combination of poor policies, arguing that Nigeria had yet to understand its true direction in economic diversification.The Nigerian economy has witnessed two recessions within the period- one fuelled by a foreign exchange crisis and the other by COVID-19.But the responses of Nigeriaƒ??s federal and state governments to issues of economy have been poor, according to analysts. Insecurity has worsened over the period and foreign exchange crisis has reached its crescendo, with naira-to-dollar exchange rate rising from N197/$ to N425 in the official market over the period ƒ?? signaling 54 per cent naira depreciation. States, the Customs, the Federal Inland Revenue Service and several government ministries and parastatals have been more concerned about revenue drive than easing business for 41.5 million small businesses and a string of large enterprises.According to the Deputy President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Gabriel Idahosa, investments were often driven by policy certainties. He said the major factor scaring investors was the unpredictability of Nigeriaƒ??s foreign exchange market/devaluation of the naira.He explained that foreign investors were skeptical about investing in Nigeria because the value of their returns would have declined in the future due to naira devaluation. Related News CBN should abolish official exchange rate ƒ?? BDC operators Save Nigeria from imminent collapse, dons beg FG Falling naira: EFCC raids Bureau De Change firms Market analyst, Ike Ibeabuchi, noted that central bank was getting the whole blame because the fiscal side was doing little.ƒ??The investment drop is not only caused by foreign exchange, but also by weak policies. The CBN has got it wrong in some areas, but what are the finance minister, the investment minister, security operatives, state governors and other stakeholders doing to make Nigerian an attractive investment hub?ƒ? he asked.The global headwinds such as COVID-19 and Russiaƒ??s invasion of Ukraine have not helped matters, having infused raw materials scarcity from wheat to oil, and pushing the central bank into raising the benchmark interest rate from 11.5? to 14 per cent in three months.MAN said the rising borrowing cost would ƒ??lead to rising cost of manufacturing inputs, which will naturally translate to higher prices of goods,low sales and enormous volume of inventory of unsold products.ƒ?ƒ??It will exacerbate the intensity of idle capital assets, worsen the already declining profit margin of private businesses and heighten the mortality rate of small businesses,ƒ? MAN further said, noting that it would hurt capacity utilisation and upscale the rate of unemployment. ƒ??Manufacturers are hopeful that the stringent conditionalities for accessing available development funding windows with the CBN will be relaxed to improve the flow of long-term loans to the manufacturing sector at single digit interest rate,ƒ? the group said in an emailed message.More than 50 Nigerian manufacturing companies have shut down in the last five years, according to investigations by The PUNCH.Some of the manufacturing companies that have exited the industry in the last five years include: Surest Foam Limited, Mufex, Framan Industries, MZM Continental, Nipol Industries, Moak Industries, and Stone Industries\"\n",
    "\"ƒ??despite no budgetary allocation for itThe Federal Government paid an interest of N405.93bn from January 2022 to April 2022 on the loans it got from the Central Bank of Nigeria through the Ways and Means Advances.This is according to data obtained from the governmentƒ??s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper 2023-2025.Ways and Means Advances is a loan facility used by the central bank to finance the government in periods of temporary budget shortfalls subject to limits imposed by law.However, there was no budgetary allocation for it in the 2022 budget.Previously, the Federal Government spent N912.57bn in 2020 and N1.12tn from January to November last year on interest on Ways and Means Advances, despite the lack of budgetary allocation for it in the budgets.The CBN said on its website that the Federal Governmentƒ??s borrowing from it through the Ways and Means Advances could have adverse effects on the bankƒ??s monetary policy ƒ?? to the detriment of domestic prices and exchange rates.

    "\"The Federal Government in partnership with the Cocoa Farmers Association of Nigeria has commenced moves to attract extra $400 on the cost of every tonne of cocoa exported from Nigeria.It was learnt that Nigeria exports about 340,000 tonnes of cocoa annually, meaning that the country is to earn an additional $136m outside the actual cost of the commodity once it perfects the process required to achieve this.Speaking at the inauguration of the National Cocoa Management Committee in Abuja on Tuesday, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Abubakar Mahmood, said officials of his ministry recently visited Ghana to study the implementation of Living Income Differential with respect to cocoa export.He explained that Ghana and Cote dƒ??Ivoire introduced the Living Income Differential as a premium on their cocoa and as tool to complement the prices of cocoa in the international market.

    "\"Amid a rising liquidity crunch, banks operating in Nigeria borrowed a whopping sum of N4.5tn from the Central Bank of Nigeria in July, an increase of 27 per cent Month-on-Month from N3.6tn borrowed in June 2022.Banks use Standing Lending Facility and Repo lending to access short-term lending from the apex bank.While the CBN lends money to banks through the SLF at an interest rate of 100 basis points above the Monetary Policy Rate currently at 14 per cent, it also lends money to banks through Repurchase Arrangement (Repo).Repos are usually considered less risky due to their short-term maturity status and the backing of the government.In the month under review, the CBN financial data shows that banks borrowing through the SLF dropped by 24.37 per cent MoM to N1.46tn in July, from N1.93tn in June, while borrowing through Repo arrangement rose sharply in July by 86.1 per cent MoM to N3.07tn from N1.65tn in June 2022.Experts have however expressed that the money market is getting tighter due to macro-economy headwinds.

He said, ƒ??Banks without liquidity might have trigger the high borrowing from the CBN. Besides, economic uncertainty has started to surface following the 2023 general elections.ƒ?Also, speaking, the Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, linked the development to low liquidity on the part of the banks.He said, ƒ??ƒ??The level of involvement of FAAC was not quite high in that month, there was no major inflow into the financial system and in the same month of July, there was a major outflow including the N180bn Dangote loan.ƒ??So those outflows impacted pressures on the bankƒ??s system liquidity that compelled banks to increase their borrowing from the lending facility.ƒ?Meanwhile, further findings showed that banks during the first seven months of 2022 borrowed N13.36tn, representing a decline of 24 per cent from N17.9tn borrowed in the prior seven months of 2021.\"\n",

    "\"A real estate development firm, Sea Global Energy Company Limited, promoters of the Ocean City Lagos Project, has accused the Lagos State Government and South Energyx, promoters of the Eko Atlantic City project, of encroaching on the geographic confines of land allocated by the Federal Government for the development of its Ocean City Lagos Project.This is happening at a time the Eko Atlantic City project is gaining traction, with banks and top companies, international organisations as well as foreign governments including the United States Consulate in Lagos acquiring parcels of land in the place.The Managing Director of Sea Global Energy Company Limited, Adewunmi Osagie, said President Olusegun Obasanjo had on May 26, 2003, given the company the right to reclaim up to 350 hectares of land from the Atlantic Ocean through an extension of Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos, by 7km, from the junction of Adetokunbo Ademola Street towards Epe.This followed an application which was made through the then Minister at the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing, Mr Madaki Alli, to the Federal Government for an allocation.The allocation, given to the company, was for the development of The Palladium Project (now known as the Ocean City Lagos Project), a coastal city that would be characterised by five districts, cutting-edge infrastructure and technology such as found in model cities in Asia, the UAE and certain parts of Europe.Following the approval, the government of Lagos State was notified and a series of meetings were held with the then governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the then Commissioner for Works, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the former DG Waterfront, Aremo Segun Oniru, and a host of other civil servants in the state.However, in 2004 and then again in 2005, by way of a reminder to the President, the Lagos State Government also sought the approval of the Federal Government on behalf of Energyx Ltd. (now known as South Energyx Ltd.) for the allocation of Bar Beach landholding. A copy of one of the letters written by the then governor Tinubu to President Obasanjo, which was made available to our correspondent, urged the Commander-in-Chief to sign off on the allocation due to the economic benefits that would accrue to the state as a result of the investment.The letter, titled, ƒ??Permanent Solution to the Bar Beach,ƒ? said the investor (Energyx Ltd) had shown commitment to finance the project which would convert the monumental liability and danger into a tourist resort that would bring significant tourist revenue, create employment and direct economic growth to the country.Obasanjo gave the approval on two conditions on April 25, 2005. The conditions were that the Federal Ministry of Works would supervise the project and any prior Federal Governments interest in the area must be respected.In an interview with our correspondent, CEO of Sea Global Energy Company Ltd, Osagie, claimed that South Energyx, in the course of delivering its Eko Atlantic City project, with the backing of the state government, encroached upon 44.348 hectares of land initially allocated by the Federal Government in 2003.She also claimed that at least three letters had been written to the office of the Federal Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, for due inquiry to be launched into the matter for the purpose of resolving it equitably and peacefully.The Sea Global Energy CEO, however, said the letters had yet to be replied to.She said, ƒ??We wrote several letters to the office of the Minister of Works, but there was no reply. The allocation was done by the Federal Government in 2003. The land belongs to the Federal Government, which is why the Governor of Lagos had to seek approval from the Federal Government for a similar allocation to be made for South Energyx. If the state government had the right to allocate the land, why didnƒ??t the governor use his powers to make the allocation to Energyx Ltd. in 2005 without approval from the President of Nigeria?ƒ? Osagie also stated that after several attempts to get the attention of critical stakeholders to resolve the conflict, Sea Global Energy lodged an action at the state high court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square before Justice Grace Modupe Onyeabor.She also sought the intervention of the Vice President after civil servants had done their work and adjudged that there was an encroachment in December 2018.There were also several memos reportedly written to Mr Babatunde Fashola who had directed that a stakeholdersƒ?? meeting be held since February 2019 for the purpose of resolving this impasse.Osagie claimed that a memo written to the minister on July 8, 2021, had yet to be treated till date.With the intervention of the Permanent Secretary, Director of Lands, Director of Legal Services, Director of the Cadastral and several other deputy directors in the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, a site visit was carried out and it was proposed that there would be a need to determinate if South Energyx had allegedly trespassed beyond the allocation given to it by the Federal Government for its Eko Atlantic City project.A letter addressed to Sea Global Energy from the Ministry, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent, read in part, ƒ??I am directed to refer to your letter of July 2, 2018 on the above subject matter and inform you that there will be need to carry out a fresh survey of the site to ascertain the extent of overlap by the activities of the Eko Atlantic City.ƒ? Related News Firm constructs 30-floor building at Eko Atlantic City Eko Atlantic City: Africaƒ??s real estate hub where square metre costs $1,720 Landwey unveils new project at Eko Atlantic A new survey map, a copy of which also was made available to our reporter, showing the allegedly encroached area, was issued by the Director of the Cadastral on behalf of the Surveyor General of the Federation to Sea Global Energy. The survey map was distinctly different from the earlier survey map issued to Sea Global in May 2003, prior to the alleged encroachment by the Lagos State Government/South Energyx.Osagie also stated that the Office of the Surveyor General, in delineating the geographical locations of the two allocations, advised on March 10, 2020 that both allocations were in different locations. While the allocation to Sea Global in May 2003 placed the Ocean City Project in the Kuramo Beach area with different coordinates, the allocation two years later to Lagos State in April 2005 placed them at the Bar Beach as requested by Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu with different coordinates. Copies of the relevant documents were made available to our reporter.Although there was a pending suit filed by Sea Global in Lagos State High Court, Lagos State Government on December 21st, 2021, lodged a fresh suit at the state high court before Justice Ogunjobi, seeking legal backing for the encroachment on the ground that the land was duly allocated to the South Energyx by the Lagos State Government.Meanwhile, it has yet to be determined if only the Federal Government alone holds the right to allocate coastal land, by virtue of several laws, including the Land Use Act 1979, Supreme Court Judgement 2003, Glover Settlement Treaty 1908, Lands (Title Vesting, etc) Act 1975 and the Nigeria Gazette (published in Lagos) on, May 18. 1944, No. 24, Vol 31.The state government, which also named South Energyx as co-applicants in the suit, sought to maintain the ƒ??legalityƒ?? of its allocation to South Energyx.However, The Sea Global CEO believes the state government and South Energy are seeking to use the court to outsmart her company.ƒ??They wanted to get a ruling behind our backs. They cooked up a suit against us but did not serve us properly. No principal officer of my company was served. My address is not a secret, but they chose to go to our former place of business, without finding out if that was still our base of operations, claiming to have ƒ??droppedƒ??? the notice with an unknown person, just so they could go back and get a ruling behind our backs. My lawyers found out and we stopped it,ƒ? Osagie alleged. When contacted, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, declined to make comments on the ground that the matter was still being arbitrated on by the courts.Efforts were also made to reach South Energyx Limited. However, the companyƒ??s representative hung up the phone after our correspondent had introduced himself.Further attempts were made to get the company to react to the issue, but all attempts proved abortive as the companyƒ??s representative declined further calls put across to the companyƒ??s official line.When our correspondent reached out to the Director of Press and Publicity, FMWH, Mrs Blessings Lere-Adam, she demanded for a written letter to be sent to the ministryƒ??s Abuja address before any response could be issued to the inquiry.A visit was also paid to South Energyx Limitedƒ??s office at Plot 1684 Sanusi Fafunwa Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. However, when our correspondent sought audience with the companyƒ??s hierarchy with a view to hearing the companyƒ??s side of the story, the companyƒ??s representative, who insisted only the companyƒ??s Managing Director could speak on the matter, declined giving our correspondent contact information through which the companyƒ??s MD could be reached.Asked if some other official had the authority to comment on the matter, the representative said the companyƒ??s attorney was also in good stead to speak on the issue, but again declined giving our correspondent contact information of the companyƒ??s lawyer.Initially conceived in 2004 as a solution to environmental hazards that arose from the flooding of the Lagos Bar Beach, the Eko Atlantic City project has snowballed to play host to one of the most expensive real estate locations in Africa, with a square metre of land now selling for almost $2,000. Eko Atlantic is an entire new coastal city being built on Victoria Island adjacent to Lagos, Nigeria. It is a focal point for investors capitalising on rich development growth based on massive demand ƒ?? and a gateway to emerging markets of the continent.In 2016, the Eko Atlantic City was commissioned by then Lagos State Governor, Akinwumi Ambode.Standing on 10 million square metres of land reclaimed from the ocean and protected by an 8.5-kilometre-long sea wall, Eko Atlantic City is projected to be the size of Manhattanƒ??s skyscraper district. Self-sufficient and sustainable, it includes state-of-the-art urban design, its own power generation, clean water, advanced telecommunications, spacious roads, and tree-lined streets.The project is privately funded by South Energyx Nigeria Limited ƒ?? the developers and city planners, a subsidiary of the Nigeria-based Chagoury Group of companies ƒ?? working in strategic partnership with the Lagos State Government and supported by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\"\n",
    "\"The Federal Government on Monday insisted that it had not raised the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, above the regulated cost of N165/litre.It said the hike in the cost of the commodity, currently between N175/litre and N230/litre, depending on the location of purchase, was done by oil marketers. The government, however, could not explain why it was not enforcing the approved price.Oil marketers across the country recently raised the price of petrol above the approved N165/litre rate without any official approval by the government. This was despite the fact that the cost of commodity was still being regulated.The marketers had argued that the N165/litre approved price was not sustainable and was contributory to the scarcity of petrol in many locations nationwide.They eventually hiked the pump price of petrol and had maintained the price increase for several weeks running without any resistance by the government.Speaking on the sidelines of the stakeholdersƒ?? consultation forum on Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulations organised by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, insisted the government had not raised the price of PMS.Asked to comment on the disparity in the pump prices of petrol and why the government had not waded into the matter, the minister said, ƒ??Well, I can tell you authoritatively that we have not deregulated. ƒ??The government is still subsidising, if there are increases in the price it is not from the government, it is probably from the marketers.ƒ??But, of course, I will talk to the NMDPRAƒ??s chief executive to ensure that they actually regulate the prices.

He disclosed this while speaking in Lagos at the maiden edition of the Nigerian Telecommunications Indigenous Content Expo organised by the Nigeria Office for Developing the indigenous Telecom Sector, an agency domiciled in the Nigerian Communications Commission, on Monday.He stated that the telecom sector already contributes a lot to the Nigerian economy and urged the government to consider taxing other sectors of the economy that were not contributing to national development.Recently, the Federal Government announced plans to implement a five per cent excise duty tax on telecoms services at a stakeholdersƒ?? forum on the implementation of excise duty on telecommunications services in Nigeria.Pantami said, ƒ??The ministry of communications and digital economy is not satisfied with any effort to introduce excise duty on telecommunication services.ƒ??Firstly, I have not been consulted officially and part of the rulemaking is to invite stakeholders to make contributions, I was not consulted officially. Secondly, if we have been contacted, we would have challenged the submission.ƒ??The sectors that are contributing to our economy today are few.

    "\"Electricity distribution companies on Sunday reacted officially to the takeover/restructuring of five Discos by the Federal Government through the Bureau of Public, describing the move as a backdoor renationalisation of the power firms.They claimed that investors in the 11 Discos were shortchanged by BPE when the facilities were privatised in November 2013, while the government had failed to pay the N100bn subsidy on electricity since the privatisation of the sector.Speaking under the aegis of the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, an umbrella body for the power firms, the Discos expressed concern about the restructuring of the five companies as announced by BPE on July 5, 2022, in collaboration with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.The Federal Government through BPE had announced the planned takeover of Kano, Benin and Kaduna electricity distribution companies by Fidelity Bank Plc after the bank initiated action to take over the boards of the three Discos.It also announced that with the takeover of Ibadan Disco by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria, the bureau had obtained approval from NERC to appoint an interim managing director for the distressed power firm.The government had further stated in its restructuring notice that it was restructuring the management and board of Port Harcourt Disco to forestall the imminent insolvency of the utility. The notice was signed by the Director-General, BPE, Alex Okoh; and Executive Chairman, NERC, Sanusi Garba.Although some of the affected power firms had commenced legal actions against the move, the Executive Director, Research and Advocacy, ANED, Sunday Oduntan, said on Sunday that the association viewed the restructuring to be inconsistent with all the guidelines necessary to comply with the framework of privatisation agreements and the rule of law. ƒ??We believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the resultant outcome has been an expropriation or backdoor renationalisation of the Discos by the Federal Government,ƒ? ANED stated in a statement issued in Abuja.It added, ƒ??Such renationalisation or expropriation must be viewed through a historical context as necessary for a proper understanding of the performance challenges that the Discos have been faced with since privatisation.ƒ??Fundamentally, the basis of privatisation was flawed from the beginning due to conditions that were not met by the Federal Government, while expecting the Discos to meet their performance obligations.ƒ??Not only were the investors shortchanged because of insufficient and unreliable data that was provided by BPE to them during the privatisation process, but the government also committed to and failed to deliver on debt-free financial books; payment of ministries, department and agencies electricity debts; and N100bn subsidy.ƒ?It outlined other areas of failure by the government to include its inability to implement a cost reflective electricity tariff, stressing that this singular unfulfilled condition had led to accrued significant debt and liabilities on the Discosƒ?? financial books, as Discos continued to sell electricity below the cost price. Related News Disco to pay community N20m damages for blackout FG to sell Discosƒ?? shares to new investors Edo Disco faults takeover by bank, vows resistance ANED further stated that the government had failed in the private management of the Transmission Company of Nigeria, currently, a government-owned and operated entity.It said the privatisation of TCN was a major requirement for attracting the private investment critical in addressing the transmission bottleneck currently belittling the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry value chain. The association said, ƒ??These commitments have remained largely unmet over the post-privatisation period and have belatedly been partially addressed ƒ?? too late to rectify current performance challenges.ƒ??While the Discos are not exonerated from responsibility for performance failures, it would be unrealistic to reach related conclusions without taking into consideration the factors that have been listed previously, as well as the Federal Governmentƒ??s contributions to these challenges.ƒ?It added, ƒ??Furthermore, there is an established process by which a change of a corporate entityƒ??s board of directors and management occurs. As such, it is with much surprise that the Disco investors awoke to the July 5, 2022, renationalisation or expropriation of the five Discos.ƒ?The association argued that due process was not followed and that the Federal Government, as a 40 per cent minority shareholder, was represented by the director-general of BPE on the board of each of the Discos and was party to all decisions concerning the operations of the Discos.It stated that what obtained in NESI currently was a misalignment of risk, technical and commercial factors, with the Disco investors bearing the brunt of the misalignment.? The Federal Government stayed mute when contacted to react to the claims by the Discos as regards the N100bn electricity subsidy.A senior official of the Federal Ministry of Power stated that the government could not speak on the issue and advised that the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission should be contacted, since it was NERC alongside BPE that approved the takeover/restructuring of the five Discos. The NERC, however, did not respond to enquiries when contacted by our correspondent on Sunday.But industry experts expressed diverse views about the move by the government to takeover/restructure the power firms.A member of the National Technical Investigative Panel on Power System Collapses (June 2013), who doubles as the President, Nigeria Consumer Protection Network, Kunle Olubiyo, stated that the move by the government should be commended.\"\n",

The initiative was launched in August 2020 to allow the CBN to fund the acquisition of meters on behalf of DisCos by paying directly to the MAPs. The free metering programme commenced with the Phase 0 where one million meters were supposed to have been distributed.However, the CBN, on July 20, asked the Federal High Court in Lokoja, Kogi State, to freeze accounts belonging to 157 MAPs for allegedly diverting funds meant for the procurement of prepaid meters.The apex bank, in a suit, requested commercial banks to restrict the account of 10 companies that received power sector intervention funds under the NMMP for 180 days pending the outcome of its investigation.Following the ongoing court case, The PUNCH, on Sunday, learnt that the free mass programme had also been put on hold until further notice.One of our sources told our correspondent that the DisCos had accused some MAPs of not supplying them with enough meters during the last visits by the CBN to the DisCosƒ?? offices. ƒ??The CBN visited the DisCos to audit their books and see what they used the intervention funds given to them for. It was during the visits that it was discovered that some of the MAPs had failed to deliver enough meters for distribution.

Apere said the regulatory recapitalisation of N5bn is expected to lead to stronger PFAs with improved capacity for more efficient service delivery.He said, ƒ??In other words, it is likely to create a level playing field in the pension sector where all PFAs would have the necessary funds to deploy adequate technology and embark on human capital development required to achieve efficiency service delivery, such as enhancing the transfer window.ƒ??Going forward, competition within the industry would mainly be based on efficient service delivery rather than capital.? However, the operators will still have different levels of capital and size of assets under management which will remain a key competitive tool despite the regulatory recapitalisation requirement.ƒ?According to him, there is need to revisit the investment returns and expenses allocation structure between the PFAs and RSA holders in order to ensure that the retireesƒ?? expectations are met.ƒ??In other words, a much higher percentage of the return on investment in pension assets must be allocated to RSA holders to cushion the effect of their retirement benefits being eroded by inflation,ƒ? he said.\"\n",

As a result, the prices had become more competitive, he said.He said the reality was beginning to create a dichotomy between the lower class and the proletarians who had to labour to match the competitive standards being set by the avalanche of investments in the real estate sector.Olamide said, ƒ??The economy is bad, but the thing is that mo matter the situation of the economy, people always want to invest in real estate. But the return on investment is guaranteed. The price of real estate always goes up. Right now, you find that a lot of people are investing a lot of money in property development in Lagos, and even outside Lagos in places like Mowe and the rest. Because of this, the price of real estate has gone up, because the demand is high. By the time a developer buys land for almost double of what he bought two years ago, the implication is that when he finishes building the house, the rent will be very high.\"\n",

    "\"It has been 19 years since Nigeria Airways was liquidated. The regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has commenced moves to establish a new national carrier amid concerns raised by major stakeholders, Funmilayo Fabunmi reportsNigerians have had to wait endlessly for the establishment of a new national carrier and stakeholders are raising questions about how long it will take the Federal Government to deliver the project which has suffered several years of delay for various reasons.The national carrier, which means a countryƒ??s national airline, locally registered under a given statute and enjoys preferential rights or privileges accorded by the government for international operations.While the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, is working to ensure that a new national carrier is reborn before the end of the year, stakeholders and industry experts familiar with the project have said it may not see the light of day, at least not under the Buhari-led administration.Some experts and stakeholders have questioned the timing and need for a national carrier, tagging it as unnecessary. Others have expressed hope in the ability of the current administration to flag off the national carrier even though campaign and elections are just around the corner.While congratulating the interim management of the national carrier headed by Captain Dapo Olumide on getting its Air Transport Licence from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, aviation expert, and the Chief Executive Officer, Finum Aviation, Sheri Kiari said, ƒ??After getting an ATL, you can now commence the five phases of AOC. So, if in the last one or two months the ATL was out and the people worked very hard, we should be expecting that they will conclude the AOC maybe sometime in September or October and then they can commence flying.ƒ??They say they have got the ATL and the AOC running concurrently. Well, we donƒ??t know how they did it but we cannot pinpoint and say this is when they finished and will now commence flying. But as far as Iƒ??m concerned, I canƒ??t see them starting any flying before October.ƒ? Aviation expert and Head of Research at Zenith Travels, Mr Olumide Ohunayo, agreed with? Kiari, noting that time, work and details going into getting an AOC might hamper the national carrierƒ??s initial kick-off date.According to Ohunayo, ƒ??They have got the ATL, what is left now is getting the AOC. For that, we are talking about a minimum of one year. I donƒ??t know how they want to finish it before the departure of this regime because you know once the elections start, everyone and even the government will be focused on it and after the election you will have the handover. Now, will the investors be interested in investing in a government that is terminating next year?ƒ??The time is quite short and I doubt they might be able to get credible investors who would want to invest at this time. Well, we need more airlines, airlines can come together and become a national carrier. We can even have national carriers or flag carriers, but that depends on the policy of the government in place.ƒ?He also registered displeasure at the move to get a national carrier for the nation, saying, ƒ??Personally, Iƒ??m not for a national carrier that protects a set of investors against another set of investors who are already in place because they have a title ƒ??national carrier.ƒ??ƒ?Aviation expert and CEO of Centurion? Aviation Safety and Security Konsult, John Ojikutu, said, ƒ??Is it a national carrier or a government carrier? Who are the shareholders, why is it so hard to be open about the partners? If itƒ??s a national carrier, who are the partners, why donƒ??t they have a name? As far as Iƒ??m concerned, that airline will not work. If we continue like this, Iƒ??m not optimistic about it. Since we havenƒ??t done it in the last four years, I donƒ??t know what we will in the next few months that will make a change.ƒ?Aviation industry stakeholder and former Director of Operations, IRS Airlines, Captain Ken Wemambu, on the question of getting an AOC in time for flag-off, said, ƒ??I donƒ??t work for Nigeria Air, but theyƒ??re doing their work very well. Captain Olumide had mentioned that that was ongoing at the same time, so I donƒ??t think that should be an issue. Theyƒ??re going through their process and itƒ??s normal for the AOC to take the actual process.ƒ??The AOC is what sets the standard of what is going to be tomorrow and Nigeria Air is going to fly to different parts of the world. When the AOC is ongoing, documentation for the aircrafts, maintenance programmes and procedures, flight programmes, trainings, everything must be scrutinised by the CAA before certificates are released. So, itƒ??s not a matter of a rush, itƒ??s a process. Theyƒ??re working on it as captain Olumide has said. ƒ??Getting an AOC depends on your readiness, and if Nigeria Air is what itƒ??s supposed to be, theyƒ??ll get it as quickly as possible but not as quickly as the ATL. Getting an AOC has five phases and I tell you, phase three is probably where they are. Itƒ??s quite exhausting, letƒ??s not rush them and I believe by the time theyƒ??re through, everybody should be happy.

You know after the ATL you have to get the certificate. Yes, both the management and NCAA are working on that and Iƒ??m very sure it will be issued soon and that will kick-start the operations of the airline. I can assure you that all hands are on deck to ensure that it takes off very soon.ƒ?When asked about the absence of staff and aeroplanes, and also the identity of the yet-to-be-known 95 per cent investors, The spokesperson for Avation, James Odaodu said, ƒ??I donƒ??t think that the recruitment of any airline, a private airline for that matter, requires any public notice. Government stake in this airline is five per cent now; thereƒ??s a transaction adviser that is working on the establishment of this airline and his work goes up to the take-off of the airline.ƒ??They (investors) cannot be underground. You are aware that there was a request for the submission of proposals sometime in early June. I think their submissions are being evaluated and once that is done, the report will be made public. The essence of making this management interim is for them to handle the issues leading to the take-off before the core investors take over. If the core investors determine in the end that the interim management should carry on, then all is well and good, but they have the right to decide what happens and put in their management. The government would definitely make public the identity of the 95 per cent investors.ƒ?Even though Capt. Ken strongly agreed with Odaodu, he dropped a few notes of warning for the survival of a national carrier.He said that in order for the flagship airline to be sustainable and not go bankrupt or even worse,? the management needed to take note of several issues. Speaking, he said, ƒ??What the minister (Hadi Sirika) is putting together and the way he has structured it may have been the right way in terms of where we have foreign investment, where people will be held accountable for what is on the table, where decisions will be taken by people who can sit together and agree where the government will not have to interfere no matter how much percentage the government has. So, we have investorsƒ?? money in the business and this will bring about what we call ƒ??sustainabilityƒ?? and itƒ??s left for the people in the system to ensure that they have sustainability officers trained and up to date who would monitor every quarter, the kind of business plan they have put in place, how to run the business plan, and put a stop to any derailment.ƒ??You donƒ??t just let the airlines fly while people make money and others lose money. Every time, there must be checks and balances. Security and efficiency are number one. It is important to see that the right things are done, and professionals are utilised at all times regardless of the country theyƒ??re from. They must make sure they have the people who are qualified and certified to do the job.ƒ??If they play with safety, they will lose the airline. One thing they should remember, no matter how expensive it is, donƒ??t mess with safety. Accidents close airlines up. Let them look at all these processes, sustainability, economic processes, how they run themselves quarterly, checks and balances, and let the right people be in the right places. With these, I donƒ??t think the airline is going to have a problem. Theyƒ??re starting well, hopefully they will continue well.ƒ?Nigeria Airways Limited, popularly known as Nigeria Airways, was founded in 1958 after the dissolution of the West African Airways Corporation. In 1958, WAAC was dissolved and renamed WAAC Nigeria, as the other partner countries pulled out to set up their own national carriers upon their independence. Nigeria maintained the WAAC brand due to the prestige it had garnered over the years.However, WAAC was eventually renamed Nigeria Airways Limited, which operated as the official national carrier of Nigeria until 2003 when the airline, due to mismanagement, owned only one aircraft and was in debt.The airline was subsequently managed by a number of foreign organisations and was rebranded over the years as Virgin Nigeria, Nigerian Eagle Airlines and Air Nigeria, but they all pulled out for various reasons. It fluctuated between foreign, local and regional routes and finally ceased operation on September 12 2012.The President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd.), who was first elected on May 29 2015, expressed concern over Nigeriaƒ??s lack of a national air carrier after receiving a briefing from the Ministry of Aviation officials. Buhari had in his first tenure inaugurated a 12-member ministerial committee to look into the establishment of a national carrier. The committee was chaired by Mohammed Abdulsalam, former managing director of Discovery Airlines. Nigerians have had to wait endlessly for the establishment of a new national carrier and stakeholders are raising questions about how long it will take the Federal Government to deliver the project which has suffered several years of delay for various reasons.\"\n",

    "\"The President, Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Dr Kayode Oluwamotemi, has advised the Federal Government to embark on a proper mapping of the country, saying that such would help the military and police to tackle insecurity and nip clashes and crimes in the bud.Oluwamotemi, who said the maps done in the 1960s used in Nigeria were obsolete and could not meet the present realities, said proper mapping was necessary if the war against insurgency, kidnapping, killings and other crimes was to be won.The NIS president, who spoke in Ado Ekiti on Saturday after reading the communique of the 56th Annual General Meeting/Conference of the institution with the theme, ƒ??Mapping policies, strategies and spatial infrastructure for sustainable e-governance in Nigeriaƒ??, also urged federal and state governments to patronise Nigerian surveyors for quality and cost-effective jobs.He said, ƒ??The first thing the government needs to do to be able to cope with insecurity is proper mapping of this country. That is when you will be able to see what is where and where is what. You will see houses and huts. When people are mobilising to cause trouble, you will see them and can act before they strike.ƒ??For instance, is Sambisa Forest properly mapped? But on the television, you see the information that is being captured with the use of drones, you can imagine, but proper mapping, maybe on the scale of 1 to 1,000, is needed. The police, the military are human beings; they can only work within the limit of their strength and what is available, but the maps are the materials that are actually needed to beat this area of insecurity.ƒ?Oluwamotemi, who said insecurity, which he described as hydra-headed, had made Nigeria lagging in the area of enabling governance, said, ƒ??We are ready as surveyors to partake to make the country governable by undertaking our surveying services.ƒ?While bemoaning lack of patronage of Nigerian surveyors by government, he said, ƒ??There is nothing in surveying and mapping that a Nigerian surveyor cannot do. Government should patronise its professionals. It would not be costly, it would not be time-barred and you will get good results.

    "\"The Director-General, International Air Transport Association, the Switzerland-based air transport body, Willie Walsh, speaks on the challenges and prospects of the global airline industry at the recently concluded 78th Annual General Meeting and World Air Transport Summit in Doha, Qatar. OYETUNJI ABIOYE was thereWhen do you think African airlines will recover?African airlines will recover in 2023 and 2024. Looking at the momentum, full recovery will be in 2024. At the global level and as an industry, it will be in 2023 but the basis is not the same everywhere. The US is back to recovery already; the US domestic market is back to what it was in 2019. It very much depends on the market. Markets with big domestic elements are recovering faster. Russian domestic market was way ahead before 2019, before the war in Ukraine. The Chinese domestic market has been recovering strongly but obviously disrupted by the closure in Beijing. If you look at Africa, it is principally an international market and therefore, the small domestic market is picking up because of all the travel restrictions that are been removed. The recovery in Africa has seen a slower pace than in other regions in the world.How would you react to the slow vaccination in Africa compared to the rest of the world?We have been saying for some time that the speed of recovery has been a high level of vaccination. The vaccination in Africa has been slower than in the rest of the world. They have not been going at the same pace.African governments have blocked international airlines from repatriating over $1bn in ticket sales proceeds. What other ways do you think airlines can get these funds from the African governments?We are looking at ways to get these funds out. It is really having an impact on the airlines and the recovery of the market as well because airlines will be reluctant to bring capacity into markets where they canƒ??t repatriate their money. It affects national growth and additional capacity. If you canƒ??t get your money out, I am sorry, it is a simple business decision, you are not going to give additional capacity to the market. Airlines are looking to recover their money and they are not going to put their funds into markets that they have no confidence in. I think this is a significant factor against recovery in the continent. It is unfortunate because it would affect the consumers, they are not going to get the choice, they are not going to get the competition and they would not be able to get the choice that they have been getting if the funds were not blocked. They are big issues, really big issues. Post-COVID-19, most countries suffered fiscally; some governments in Africa applied to the IMF and some think they could hold on to airlinesƒ?? funds. What steps do you think IATA is taking to ensure other countries do not follow such a path?All we need to do is to make it clear to people that it will have consequences. The idea that the industry went into bankruptcy because of closures and still lost a huge amount of money doesnƒ??t work that way, and that does not allow them (African governments) to keep airlinesƒ?? funds.? Airlines are not rich. We donƒ??t have a lot of cash. If all people do is undermine the recovery in the industry, it is going to have a direct impact on the services that they give.There is a discrepancy in the IATA and the Central Bank of Nigeriaƒ??s exchange rates; this creates a ƒ??fightƒ?? all the time between travel agents and the public. How do we solve this problem in the area of the exchange rate?It is impossible to solve because these differences have existed forever. I honestly donƒ??t see a simple solution to that. It could be good if it is made to be aligned or closely aligned. You are right. In some cases, the difference is significant. I donƒ??t see a simple solution to it.I am actually concerned about skyrocketing Jet A1 which is taking a toll on not only African airlines but global airlines. Could you tell us how this is impacting the operations of African airlines and how they can mitigate this?It has a serious impact on the airlines and the price of basic commodities. The oil Brent benchmark that we use is very much influenced by what is happening in Ukraine-the sanctions against Russian oil-and that has driven up the price of oil quite significantly. The second aspect is the difference between a barrel of Brent and a barrel of JetA1 and the lack of capacity in refining. There was little demand for Jet A1 during the pandemic, obviously because the value of the activities by airlines had reduced. We switched attention away from Jet A1 to other products. It is not easy for them to switch back. You cannot just do it overnight. So, we need to see a return to refining capacity. The 10 years between 2010 and 2019, Brent averaged $80 per barrel and 17 per cent on average. Jet fuel was about $93, $94 per barrel. We are looking at an average cost of 25 per cent basic at $100 on average. So, Jet A1 is $125. Brent jumped from $80 to $100. Both of these have increased and both of these have an impact. In the same period, fuel represents 20 per cent of the industry cost base. In that ten-year period in the history of the industry, the average cost was five and a half per cent. Airlines do not have big profit margins and ultimately, these prices are passed on to the consumers on ticket prices. No one is avoiding that if your biggest cost escalates. The industry cannot absorb this that is why you are seeing (the high) ticket prices. Ticket prices would be highly influenced by supply and demand, and in certain cases, the pace at which demand has recovered has been faster than the pace at which supply has returned to the market; and that clearly leads to pushing prices up. Related News Nigeria, other African countries need 20,000 pilots ƒ??Report Financial crisis: NCAA audits distressed airlines Aero suspends operations amid skyrocketing JetA1 price, others In what ways do you think African airlines and governments can tap into sustainable aviation fuel? I think it is a huge opportunity for African countries. They do not need to rely on oil and gas to be extracted. You develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) which is in huge demand. You have invested in the production facilities and refining capacity. This will help you to reduce your dependence on imports for Jet A1. I genuinely believe that if I was a politician, I will be looking at this huge opportunity because you have the feedstock. You can actually generate sustainable fuel from multiple sources, generate new jobs and you will be able to generate a product that you can sell and help the environment as well. If ICAO is saying this to African countries, I will be saying it as well. There is no risk because the airline industry would need to save fuel. The demand for this product is huge. The demand will continue to increase in the next 10, 15 years. People are looking at opportunities to make investments. It is a great opportunity.How do you think this can affect the future of African airlines?The issue of SAF is not just an African issue for African airlines; our strong belief is that SAF can be produced in Spain, exported to Africa. You add that to the transport cost, the carbon footprint of transporting it, it would be more useful to produce SAF in Africa. It does not only constitute a challenge for African airlines, it is a challenge for many airlines across the world. I also think it is a huge opportunity for governments and countries across the world.Do you subscribe to a bailout for African airlines and the aviation industry?Yes, I welcome a bailout but the problem I have with a bailout is that it is not sustainable in the long-term and it kills the innovation that is necessary. It helps airlines to navigate any crisis but it is not the most sustainable in the long term. They delay the restructuring or the needed innovation by airlines because you have got a temporary reprieve. If you donƒ??t take the advantage of temporary reprieve, you will just be back in crisis. The only way you can guarantee your future is to drive innovation and efficiency and to make sustainable true economic planning. It is not just African countries but the African countries contribute most significantly to the industryƒ??s platforms.Some African governments are looking at airport concession and privatisation. What do you think about this?The only thing we can do is try to convince governments to face up to the responsibilities that they have. We have seen airlines whose funds were trapped completely leave the country like Venezuela. The rest that did not stop significantly reduce the capacity to the country and restricted sales. We canƒ??t advise the airlines on what they should do. That is the decision for the airlines to take. Airports that are privatised do not guarantee a return because they are just going to drive costs, you are preventing innovation because it is going to just guarantee returns. Most African countries are planning to set up national airlines, what is your take on this?Airlines can be created by anybody at any time. We have had very successful airlines and unsuccessful airlines. I will never say to people donƒ??t do it because definitely, you know what the challenges are.The Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) is a project of the African Union to create a single market for air transport in Africa. SAATM and air liberalisation has been described as a game changer in Africa. What specifically is IATA doing in conjunction with African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) in realising this goal?The SAATM has to be an opportunity, It has to do with deregulation that has benefitted consumers in other markets that had been deregulated. Europe is a great example of that. So, it gives a massive increase in connectivity, an increase in the number of flights, increases in the number of activities, and much better competition. The consumer wins. This will benefit the African consumers, the connectivity which has a huge benefit for the industry and the economies; it is the right way to go. A fragment of the market will not be sufficient as a single, open competitive market. We still have the US domestic market as a single, open competitive market which is a deregulated market; you have new entrants taking advantage of new opportunities and fantastic for consumers. I think African economies have to concentrate most on what would benefit them from the market.\"\n",

A widespread deficit of pilots across all continents has affected the sector, particularly in recent years, with cases of pilot shortages regularly occurring.

    "\"The number of functional oil rigs in Nigeria increased by 37.5 per cent in the second quarter of this year amidst a plunge in the countryƒ??s crude oil production in the same quarter.An oil rig or oil production platform is a large structure with facilities to extract and possibly process petroleum and natural gas that lie beneath the seabed.Latest data on global oil rig count obtained by our correspondent on Friday from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries showed that Nigeriaƒ??s functional oil rigs increased from eight in the first quarter of 2022 to 11 in the second quarter.It was further observed that the countryƒ??s functional rigs had dropped from 10 in the third quarter of last year to seven in the fourth quarter of 2021.It, however, increased to eight in Q1 2022 before rising to 11 in Q2 2022, as findings showed that in the months of April, May and June this year, 11 oil production rigs in Nigeria were functional in each of the months.But the rise in rig count for Nigeria did not translate to an increase in crude oil production in the second quarter of this year.Sunday PUNCH had exclusively reported that Nigeriaƒ??s oil production crashed by about 14.94 million barrels in the second quarter of this year, based on latest oil production data obtained from OPEC. The report had also stated that an analysis of figures released by OPEC and the average cost of crude in Q2 2022 obtained from global oil price reports, indicated that Nigeriaƒ??s oil earnings plunged by about N703.76bn, being the worth of the 14. 94 million barrels of crude that was lost during the review period.It stated that in OPECƒ??s crude oil production data based on direct communication from its 13-member nations, the organisation revealed that in the first quarter of this year, Nigeria produced 1.299 million barrels of oil per day.But this dropped to 1.133 million barrels per day in the second quarter, indicating a plunge of 166,000 barrels per day.This implies that for the estimated 90-day period in Q2 2022, the country could not produce or lost about 14.94 million barrels of crude oil.

Komolafe in a recent oil sector presentation, obtained by our correspondent, said, ƒ??As you all know, the nation has suffered significant losses in crude oil production especially in land and swamp terrains due to economic sabotage popularly known as ƒ??crude oil theftƒ??.ƒ??A major consequence of this nefarious activity is the declaration of force majeure at Bonny Oil and Gas Terminal and shut-in of wells from fields evacuating through the Nembe Creek Trunk Line and the Trans Niger Pipeline. ƒ??A consequential effect of this menace is that the nation only achieved about 60 per cent compliance with Technical Allowable Rate and 72 per cent of its assigned OPEC quota.ƒ?On the other hand, the NUPRC boss stated that the socio-economic impact of production and associated revenue losses to both government and investors was a deep cause for concern for all stakeholders.He said, ƒ??The challenges that stem from this issue include threat to national and energy security, erosion of global competitiveness and ease of doing business, rise in unemployment across the industry, increase in conflicts due to proliferation of arms and widespread HSE (health, safety and environmental) and community concerns, etc.ƒ?Komolafe, however, noted that in light of these issues and governmentƒ??s production target of three million barrels of oil per day in three years, the NUPRC had developed regulatory initiatives and optimisation strategies aimed at decreasing this menace to the barest minimum in the short run, and eventual elimination in the long run.He said the strategies involved various industry stakeholders and cuts across techno-socioeconomic and security initiatives.ƒ??It is my utmost belief that the impact of these joint strategies would be felt across the industry in a few months,ƒ? he stated.Komolafe added, ƒ??Against this backdrop, the initiative to conduct an industry-wide integrated study on the reactivation of shut-in strings was conceptualised in the commission and approved by me as a low hanging strategy to gain incremental production.ƒ?\"\n",

    "\"The Chief Executive Officer of Ikeja Electric Plc, Folake Soetan, in this interview with OPEOLUWANI AKINTAYO, opens up on some of the power sector challengesThe IKEDC had a challenge of N70bn debts owed by customers and MDAs in August 2021. Have you been able to recover the money?The emphasis has shifted from debts to some other things. The business is in stages. For instance, in 2016/2017, we had issues with customers asking us to come and take our lines due to a low supply. The challenge we had then was that we didnƒ??t have supply and customers were frustrated and kept clamouring for supply. Then, there was a phase when we started having supplies, and the challenge of customers complaining of estimated billing, while DisCos complained of inappropriate pricing. That was when the issue of shortfalls and debts came in. So, we decided on how to recover the shortfalls. Ministries, Department and Agencies still owe us and that was when Fashola was the minister. He asked us to compile a list of debtors as they were going to manage it. From there, we started doing bilateral power, then we started Metering Assets Providers, MAPs. The MAPs came, and it took a long time to work due to teething problems. We had the issue of dollar fluctuation; forex was high that even to clear the equipment at the port was a problem. So, MAPs didnƒ??t take off until much later. Then, COVID-19 came. During COVID-19, there was an improved power supply, but MAPs was slow. That was when the government introduced the service-based tariffs ƒ?? to make customers begin to pay according to how much electricity they consumed. But before that time, we had already started the bilateral power which was becoming very successful, especially with people at Magodo (Lagos) as they started experiencing 24 hours supply. Ikeja GRA too keyed into the bilateral power. In September 2020, there was clamour against the service-based tariffs from the organised labour and other parties, and that was when the government said it should be suspended and redesigned. In November 2020, the government came with revised tariffs. That was when the National Mass Metering Programme was introduced to cushion the effects of the tariffs. The metering programme was not based on affluence because it is what you use that will reflect on your meter.Now, customers are sometimes confused between MAPs and the Federal Governmentƒ??s free metering programme. Consumers think meters are supposed to be free.Itƒ??s just the Federal Governmentƒ??s meters that are free. The ones under MAPs are not free. Why would someone say DisCos are going to distribute meters for free without cancelling the MAPs? What we were told is that we should keep selling meters via MAPs. Government also knows that people are willing to pay for meters. No matter what you read on the pages of newspapers, if we donƒ??t see any letter from NERC or the Federal Government, the DisCos wonƒ??t do anything about it. We act based on whatever we are told officially.What the DisCos and the NERC told journalists when MAPs was about to commence was that customers who bought meters would be refunded with electricity units. But as we speak, electricity consumers are yet to be refunded. What is going on?For the record, we are not aware of any such arrangement. There are no modalities towards refunding anybody. But what we canƒ??t say is if NERC has such in the pipeline. But providing meters is solely the responsibility of DisCos because they are your properties.What we are saying is that meters are available for those who want to buy. We are not compelling anyone to buy meters under the MAPs. The NERC could have approached DisCos so that modalities would be reached if they wanted those who bought to be refunded. Ikeja Electric has never come out to say we would refund customers who buy meters under MAPs. Whether it is going to happen, we are not aware. Whatever is going to happen will be documented and sent to us and we follow it up. This statement was made as at the time MAPs was launched. As at that time, no one knew they would launch the mass metering programme. At that time, there were stories in the newspapers that nobody should buy meters again. That statement was made by a politician vying for a post then. I donƒ??t want to mention names. He was practically saying MAPs was dead and that consumers should wait for free meters from the NMMP. But the free metering was stopped after the first round, and MAPs was brought back. We need to be careful. Let NERC write to us that we should not sell meters again, then, we will stop it.How do you measure the health of a DisCo? Related News No meter, no payment, Lagos residents protest at IKEDC office Firm upgrades Lagos workshop to train students Two men docked for allegedly beating up IKEDC officials One of the ways is through the AT&T losses. The lower the losses, the more robust the business is. Have you ever noticed that no DisCo in Nigeria is appraised based on customer relations? No, because thatƒ??s not the parameter to measure the resources of a DisCo. A DisCo may be the best at managing customer issues but the other basic parameters that will make sure it remains sustainable, if low, will make the DisCo go down. Those DisCos that had challenges had those issues because of their book balances. They could not sustain their operations. The truth is that customers have their reality; the government has its reality; and NERC also has its own reality. If the government, for instance, is looking for foreign investments, it is the health of the business they will look at. So, if a DisCos is not healthy, who will invest in it? So, I think it is important when we are measuring because I see people applauding when DisCos were being taken over.The regime that we have now is such that everyone is expected to live up to their responsibilities because we have signed contracts. The nation is tired of embarrassment. Thatƒ??s why people are even saying we should at least sustain the 5000MW that we have first. So, what regulator measures us with is different from what customers are thinking. So, when you see us chasing some certain things, itƒ??s not because we donƒ??t have customers in mind. Our slogan is ƒ??customers firstƒ?? but it may not translate to immediate change, but ultimately, there will be changes that they want to see. Now, everybody in Magodo is an evangelist of Ikeja Electric, whereas three or four years ago, Magodo residents did not even want to have anything to do with us. They almost spat on our faces when we went there. Our idea is to make sure that the whole of our network is like Magodo where residents enjoy 24 hours steady electricity.Have the DisCos signed the gas contract spoken by the NERC in view of the 5000MW target?What you need to understand is that we should not generalise DisCos. We have individual and unique identities. Itƒ??s not our responsibility to deliver 5000MW. ? The NERC said while GenCos must deliver 5000MW, DisCos must take all, and any defaulting party would be penalised.The 5000MW is not enough to cover the whole of Nigeria. It is not even enough for the DisCos. What they are generating now, how many megawatts go to each DisCo that we wonƒ??t be able to take? It is when they are able to generate 10,000 or 15,000 megawatts, and where they will be asking Ikeja Electric to pick 2000MW then, we would say we donƒ??t have the capacity to take all. Our current infrastructure is capable of picking whatever they give us. How much are they even giving us daily? Ikeja Electric takes the highest, and itƒ??s 15 per cent of whatever is being generated, between 400-500MW daily. And itƒ??s not every day we get that. I have been shying away from putting figures to the kind of investments we make on our network.Is it true that whatever bill is not collected from pre-paid meter users is shared to those on estimated billing even when those areas did not enjoy stable electricity?? In those days, what used to happen was people complaining about arbitrary bills. The first step was for us to meter the transformers to know how much came in from there. After metering them, we see whatever was consumed by all the areas under our network. And based on different parameters, we would make our calculations. In that case, we now look at the prepaid meters and see what was consumed. Based on the parameters we have put there then, we adopted a calculation called ƒ??daily methodologyƒ?? to address the matter. After a while, people still complained that it was not working. What people donƒ??t understand is that when they say they are paying excessively, someone in the three bedroom uses a gas cylinder. Someone in one bedroom uses an electric cooker bought from Lawanson. Those things are 10 years old. The more modern they are, the less electricity they consume. So, the NERC introduced capping and we were asked to remove our billing methodology. Based on certain parameters mostly on availability of electricity, we canƒ??t charge them more than a certain amount. So, some people in certain areas are on capping, but their bill is high because of the availability of power supply. Donƒ??t forget that the guy using a prepaid meter is more careful in managing his light than those without prepaid meters.What is the fate of consumers who invest in transformers?? It is our responsibility to do all that for customers. But the issue is that we all know the challenges of the power sector and even other sectors that everything canƒ??t be done at a time. Some people request for poles; some request for aluminium conductors; and some request meters. What is the essence of government intervention? Itƒ??s because they know that DisCos cannot fund everything alone. That is why we keep telling those that want to invest in our networks that we are the ones that should be responsible for them. But some will tell us that they canƒ??t wait until we are able to reach them, which is why you see some communities coming to say they would do some things by themselves. Then, we will ask them to commit themselves in a letter that they were the ones that offered to do those things willingly. Itƒ??s just like the metering we are talking about. Itƒ??s because some people cannot wait for free meters that? NERC said we should allow willing customers to purchase their meters. Itƒ??s not as if we are not doing anything. As you were coming in, I am sure you saw a big transformer outside that we just brought in, itƒ??s a giant transformer just like the one used in installing injection boxes.\"\n",
    "\"The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry has told the Federal Government to jettison its plan to ban the activities of miners in the country.The chamber made the call in a statement titled, ƒ??LCCI statement on the proposed nationwide ban on motorcycles and mining activities,ƒ? which was signed by its Director-General, Dr Chinyere Almona.It said the consideration by the National Security Council to impose a nationwide ban on motorcycles and mining activities in the country was acknowledged as a strategy to curb terrorist activities and disconnect them from their sources of funding, according to the government.According to the statement, the Mining and Solid Minerals Group of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry was concerned about the unintended consequences this ban would have on the mining sector and the business environment.The statement read in part, ƒ??Whilst it can be understood that criminals use motorcycles as means of mobility and escape from the security agencies, it is unacceptable to label the entire Nigerian mining ecosystem as sponsors of banditry and terrorism. This looks like an attempt to blame all legitimate mining operators for the activities of bandits and terrorists operating in Nigeria.ƒ??The Nigerian mining industry employs several thousand in the formal and informal economy of Nigeria. Specifically, the artisanal and small-scale mining ecosystem accounts for at least 90% of the activities in the mining sector; from granite quarrying, limestone mining, to base metals mining, limestone mining for cement production, sand mining, non-metallic industrial inputs for the paint and pharmaceutical industry, to mining of precious metals like gold; as well as gemstones mining.ƒ? Related News FG moves to reposition advertising Industry FG destroys 48 containers of fake pharmaceuticals FG to commence health coverage for vulnerable citizens According to LCCI, duly licensed mining companies should be clearly differentiated and distanced from the activities of bandits and terrorists whom the National Security Council had based their proposal upon.

We should also finalize the plan to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency. All of these would make it easy to access information on mining by investors across the globe.ƒ?On his part, the Director-General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, John Udeagbala, in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, described the issue as a double-edged sword which required a critical deliberation before a stance could be taken on the proposal.He said, ƒ??We heard about that, but it a double-edged, and we know that a lot of crimes are associated with those artisanal miners with motorcycles, like in Zamfara. So, we have been trying to weigh it and analyse the situation before coming up with a position. It is two-pronged; we know there are genuine miners who have licenses.

The motion was entitled, ƒ??State of CBN Intervention Funds and Free Fall Of Naira.ƒ?Coming under orders 41 and 51 of the Senate Standing Order, as amended, Adetunmbi bemoaned Nigeriaƒ??s economic reality amid an urgent call for ƒ??extraordinary measures.ƒ?He noted that the CBN, through its numerous multi-sectoral intervention funds, had provided special funds to support critical sectors of the economy.He explained that in view of such interventions, it had become necessary to assess the state of implementation and effectiveness of the funds deployed for the purpose.The lawmaker recalled that the CBN, in 2021, placed an indefinite halt on forex bidding by BDC operators and importers over allegations of abuse and mismanagement.He observed that the halt by the CBN had resulted in a spike of the exchange rate.According to Adetunmbi, ƒ??the two instruments of Personal Travel Allowance (PTA) and Business Travel Allowance (BTA) could only serve less than 20 per cent of the total forex demand by travelers and businesses.ƒ? He expressed worry that the import and export window meant to serve the forex needs of business giants, ƒ??has become a rare opportunity that only a privileged few can access.ƒ?ƒ??These and a number of others have contributed to the excessive scarcity of forex in Nigeria today,ƒ? he added.In his contribution, Senator Sani Musa (APC ƒ?? Niger East), faulted the Central Bankƒ??s decision to halt foreign exchange biddings, thereby cutting off the parallel market ƒ?? Bureau de change operators.According to him, the attempt by the CBN to control the value of the naira with the continuous exclusion of BDCs would only lead to its further depreciation.He, therefore, advised the apex bank to rather ensure the regulation and monitoring of the parallel market.ƒ??What CBN used to do was to give out $10,000 (USD) to each of these BDCs with a clear directive for it not to be sold above N470 as against the $419 exchange rate. It worked.ƒ??But today, nobody is determining where the rate is going and I can assure you we canƒ??t have that solution because we are only importing,ƒ? he said. On his part, Senator representing Katsina North District, Senator Ahmad Babba-Kaita, said one way to improve the value of the naira was to encourage foreign investments to attract inflow of other currencies into Nigeria.ƒ??The only way we can access the dollar will be determined by other economies and not ours,ƒ? he noted.He, however, attributed the lack of foreign investments into Nigeria to the poor security situation caused by banditry, terrorism, and other criminal activities.The Senate, in its resolutions, called on the CBN to urgently intervene to stop the rapid decline in the value of the naira vis-? -vis the dollar and other international currencies.It also mandated the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance, and Other Financial Institutions to conduct an assessment of CBN intervention funds and the declining value of naira to come up with sustainable solutions.\"\n",

    "\"The crash of the naira, hike in the cost of aviation fuel, among other industry concerns have worsened the battle for survival by domestic airlines, raising aviation safety fears among operators and stakeholders, Okechukwu Nnodim reportsThe Federal Government, operators in the aviation sector, as well as passengers have all admitted to the fact that the industry is currently in a crisis.Although there have been several meetings between government officials and stakeholders, the challenges confronting the sector have refused to abate, a development that has led to the suspension of operations of some domestic carriers.Notable among the reasons for the crisis in the sector are the crash of the local currency, naira, against the United States dollar; and the astronomical hike in the cost of aviation fuel, popularly called JetA1.This challenge in the air transportation business is gradually creating aviation safety fears among operators and stakeholders, though the Federal Government, through its Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, is battling to keep the industry safe.ƒ??The crisis, of course, is creating air safety fears not just among stakeholders, but among the flying public and within some very senior government officials,ƒ? an aviation expert and President, Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria, Kingsley Nwokeoma, stated.The umbrella organisation for the countryƒ??s domestic carriers, Airline Operators of Nigeria, attributed the crisis in the sector to the high cost of JetA1 and the difficulty in accessing foreign exchange required for the business. The crisis recently led to the halt in the operations of two popular domestic carriers, Aero Contractors and Dana Air, though investigations by the NCAA are ongoing as regards the safety of Dana Air.On July 18, 2022, Aero Contractors announced that due to the impact of the challenging operating environment on its daily operations, the management of company wish to effect the temporary suspension of its scheduled passenger services operations with effect from July 20, 2022.ƒ??This decision was carefully considered and taken due to the fact that most of our aircraft are currently undergoing maintenance, resulting in our inability to offer a seamless and efficient service to our esteemed customers,ƒ? the carrier had stated in a statement.The firm further stated that the past few months had been very challenging for the aviation industry and the airline operators in particular.ƒ??With the high cost of maintenance, skyrocketing fuel prices, inflation, and forex scarcity resulting in high foreign exchange rates. These are among the major components of airline operations,ƒ? it stated.The airline, however, noted that it was working assiduously to return to service as quickly as possible.Also, on July 20, 2022, the NCAA announced the suspension of Dana Airƒ??s Air Transport Licence and Air Operator Certificate indefinitely, which took effect from midnight of same day. NCAAƒ??s Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu, disclosed this in a statement, adding that the authority had informed the management of Dana Air.The statement partly read, ƒ??The decision is the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the airline by the authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the airlineƒ??s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Air is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.ƒ??The NCAA acknowledges the negative effect this pre-emptive decision will have on the airlineƒ??s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding, as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.ƒ?Providing some explanation as to the cause of the crisis in the sector, the AFARN president told our correspondent that the situation in the aviation industry was not only local but global.He said, ƒ??After the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact is not just on the domestic sector, it is on global aviationfor us all to see, because even the bigger carriers, world carriers have cut down their orders from Boeing and Airbus.ƒ??And if you also notice, everybody is trying to work around cost. And, of course, Nigeria is part of the world. So, apparently, the crisis will also get to us. Then this is coupled with the Russia-Ukraine war and all the issues going on, especially for a country like ours that donƒ??t have functional refineries.ƒ??We donƒ??t refine our own aviation fuel, just like normal fuel too, everything is imported. So it is a very big issue. If we had refineries, if we could produce our own, perhaps we wouldnƒ??t have been in this state. So all these trends are affecting us.ƒ? On the collapse of airlines, Nwokeoma stated that operators in the sector saw it coming, adding that there was still fear that another domestic carrier might suspend operations soon.ƒ??Of course, we saw Aero coming. Of course, it happened. Dana also happened. And the question is, whoƒ??s next? Because apparently when we have issues and everybody is trying to work around staying afloat, or staying alive, there is the tendency that safety might be compromised,ƒ? he stated.Nwokeoma added, ƒ??From last year to this year, weƒ??ve been having this price increase in airfares, moving from N30,000-plus to over N50,000 and now about N100,000. Now who is going to fly? Related News FG approves N7.5bn for airport gadgets, irrigation projects Abuja second runway ready in 12 Months ƒ?? Aviation minister Africa has vibrant travel market ƒ??Ferri ƒ??The flying public will have to look for alternatives. So the government needs to sit down with the carriers if we are to still have a domestic aviation sector, because the average man canƒ??t afford these tickets. Thatƒ??s the truth.ƒ?He, however, stated that the price hike in air tickets was justifiable, as the major component in air transportation business had also skyrocketed in cost.ƒ??Aviation fuel is the major component. So, if you donƒ??t have fuel, you canƒ??t fly. The fuel price is going astronomically high and that means it will reflect on the tickets. So itƒ??s a serious situation that we have here, just like Allen Onyema (Chairman, Air Peace) said during the Nigeria Aviation Conference,ƒ? the AFARN president stated.Nwokeoma added, ƒ??He (Onyema) said that it might get to a point where we would not even have carriers flying, because if you are spending all your money in buying fuel, then what of the other components like maintenance, payments of salaries, training, etc. ƒ??So itƒ??s the situation that we have here and it might degenerate if the government does not sit down with these carriers and find the solution on how to manage this crisis, for we are not close to crisis. We are in crisis already.ƒ?Nwokeoma observed that though the government had been meeting with airlines on some of those issues, such meetings had yet to yield the desired results.He said, ƒ??We are saying we canƒ??t lose that sector because that is where it is tending towards currently. And there is little that the airlines can do if the fuel cost is going very high. The only solution is to keep raising fares and that will affect the masses.ƒ??If youƒ??re going to Abuja, and youƒ??re going to be spending close to N200,000, then itƒ??s a problem. How much does the middle class earn? So that means people will start looking for alternatives regardless of whether there is security crisis or otherwise.ƒ?ƒ??What it means is that if it is not affordable, if it is extremely high, then people will start looking at other forms of transportation. So we need an intervention to keep that sector going.ƒ?The on July 19, 2022 explained that the JetAl crisis began in late February and deteriorated further through the months of March to May, and further worsened to the point of threatening the ability of airlines to continue operations.ƒ??The price of JetA1 rose suddenly from N200 in December 2021 to over N400/litre in February. Today the price has skyrocketed to over N800/litre,ƒ? the association had stated. It added, ƒ??On top of the continuous rise in the price of aviation fuel, supply is at best epileptic and unpredictable at several airports across the country thereby causing flight delays, and even cancellations, as airlines queue for fuel at airports across the country.ƒ??Added to the already difficult situation, is the high cost and scarcity of foreign exchange. It is pertinent to note that airlines carry out most of their activities in dollars.ƒ?However, amidst these challenges and crisis, the Federal Government and its NCAA have vowed to ensure that the air transportation business remained safe.ƒ??It is our core mandate to ensure that the aviation sector is safe and that is what weƒ??ve been doing and will continue to do,ƒ? the spokesperson, NCAA, Sam Adurogboye, told our correspondent.Also, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, on Tuesday stated that though there was no immediate solution to the crisis rocking the industry, the government was making efforts to address the challenges.Sirika had said, ƒ??Energy crises is real and it is global. Today there is aviation fuel problem all over the world. From America to New Zealand. It is aggravating in Nigeria because we donƒ??t produce the product.ƒ??It is aggravated also because the foreign exchange is scarce in Nigeria and the source of earning the foreign exchange has also has dwindledƒ?. He said the Federal? Government had in the past sourced 10,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel for domestic airlines, adding that the government was wiling to do more.ƒ??As we speak, the government is in the process of finding a permanent? solution to this issue,ƒ? Sirika stated.Outlining some of the the solutions, the minister said it would include, ƒ??importation of the product at the appropriate price, accelerating the refurbishment of our refineries and also wait for the coming on stream of Dangote Refinery to boost supply of the product.ƒ?He, however, noted that this would not happen soon.ƒ??So when you ask how soon, I wouldnƒ??t know when Dangote will come on stream, I wouldnƒ??t know how soon the refineries will be fixed. I wouldnƒ??t know when imports would become sufficient. But the government is working towards all these to happen,ƒ? Sirika stated.The minister said he would meet with relevant stakeholders including the Central Bank of Nigeria so that the airlines could access forex at the official rate rather than the black market price.\"\n",

What is Nigeria?.ƒ?Speaking in a telephone interview with The PUNCH, aviation expert and the Chief Executive Officer, Centurion Aviation Security and Safety Consult, John Ojikutu said, ƒ??To adhere to periodic maintenance of those facilities, none of those facilities is less than 20 years and that is why most of the time I always ask, do we have a maintenance programme?ƒ??This airport was commissioned in 1977. Between that time and now, even if your maintenance programme is regular, those facilities are outdated. But I think that thereƒ??s a program now to change all of them. When you bring people even from abroad to help with maintenance, most of the parts are outdated. So, even if you bring new parts, they will not fit. So, the problem with us is this, what is the lifespan of things that we put there, do we have it?ƒ?He explained, ƒ??Secondly, do we have a maintenance programme for it. If we donƒ??t have it, we have a problem. Sometimes it may not necessarily be because there is no money, it may be because we did not adhere to the maintenance and the contract on it. If youƒ??re keeping a conveyor belt and an avio bridge of 1977, and youƒ??re retiring the people that are maintaining them and the new people youƒ??re bringing in donƒ??t have the knowledge of the old machines, when they get to a standstill, the only people you can call upon are the manufacturers.ƒ??When they come, they tell you that ƒ??this equipment is about 30 years old, where are you going to get the spare parts?ƒ??? Even with maintenance, you canƒ??t get the spare parts from the original owners because they have changed; they are moving to the next step, that is one problem we have. He added, ƒ??The second problem is even your own maintenance crew. Will there be people that you have kept in the service since 1977 till now? Even the ones that are coming in are learning from the ones that are going out. But itƒ??ll get to a stage where the knowledge is lost completely and everything remains static. The good thing, which I heard last week from the higher authority, is that they are changing everything, not repairing it. Theyƒ??re going to change everything at the international airport.ƒ?The CEO, Finum Aviation Services, Sheri Kyari, said that the situation had lingered too long and expressed displeasure at the state of the airport.He said, ƒ??These issues have lingered for about 15 years or more. A lot of stakeholders are not happy about it because of economic and most importantly, safety issues. We thank God that they are looking at fixing the runway lightning. The issue of faulty conveyor belts beats oneƒ??s imagination because theyƒ??re supposed to be facilities that should be in constant maintenance.ƒ??Itƒ??s difficult to replace it because of the continuous flow of traffic, but if they have two wings that are doing this, they should be able to close down one to repair it and make it functional.

We keep praying they do that. Apart from the conveyor belt, there might be other issues that we all know that FAAN is addressing like the increase in the terminal buildings at the international airport with a new terminal and a car park. Itƒ??s an improvement over what theyƒ??ve had for some time. We pray that they look at them and repair them. But again, with the concession that is coming, if it goes through, we pray that whoever is going to buy any of the airports will look at all those issues and fix them.ƒ?The Managing Director, FAAN, Captain Rabiu Yadudu, about a month ago at an interactive session with aviation journalists in Lagos, stated that FAAN had begun the replacement and repair of aged equipment used to carry out its daily operations at airports across the country.? Speaking, Yadudu said that FAAN had inaugurated an ad hoc committee in 2021 because it saw that most of the facilities were aged. He said that the pieces of equipment were supposed to be replaced every 15 years, but some had more than doubled the specified years. He said, ƒ??The major repair relates to aging equipment and components. I gave you an example in Lagos ƒ?? abandoned runway and airfield lighting. Second is the key elements at the MMA and any other airport that we did not replace, but now, we are replacing them.ƒ??Some were last replaced in either 1980 or 1985. Now, we are replacing them. It is only the air-conditioning system that we have not yet procured, but we are processing it and the airfield lighting.ƒ??However, for all other basic ones such as disabled aircraft, baggage handling and other basic ones that the people see every day, we have started with them. On the avio-bridges, we have started with them and that is in terms of infrastructure.The Head, of Research and Corporate Travel at Zenith Travels & Consult, Olumide Ohunayo, said, ƒ??Like the MD (Capt. Yadudu) said, the facilities are old, same as the airport itself, hence the plan to tear it down rather than continue to invest money in repairing it and all those things. I think some of those facilities are supposed to be removed completely because the spares are not even available and the ad hoc measures put in place to make them function cannot always be effective.ƒ??We have a new terminal, though constrained by the airside space, which has made airlines not to move in there. We have just about two airlines there and others are complaining about the space. So, I think while they decide to work on the space of the new terminal, itƒ??s better to just tear down that airport and replace everything. That looks like a better option rather than continuing to patch.ƒ?Barely a month after Yaduduƒ??s comments on the aged airport and equipment, the domestic runway of MMA, Lagos, was completely closed and it will remain so for three months to enable some repairs and installation of Air Field Lighting to be done. The AFL is one of many things that are wrong with the airport.FAAN confirmed the runway closure in a statement titled, ƒ??Airfield lighting installation: FAAN to close domestic runway 18L/36R.ƒ? The statement read in part, ƒ??As part of efforts aimed at improving safety and efficiency of flight operations at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has concluded arrangements to complete the installation of CAT III Airfield Ground Lighting system on Runway 18L/36R. The project, which will commence effectively on Friday, July 8, 2022, is expected to last for 90 days. Consequently, Runway 18L/36R will be closed to flight operations during this time. However, stakeholders are to note that there will be no disruption. All normal flight operations will be conducted through runway 18R/36L. A NOTAM (Notice to Air Men) to this effect has already been published and disseminated accordingly.ƒ??? Though a welcome move, some airline operators and industry observers have decried the move, saying that the agency should have adopted a partial runway closure approach to the project. He noted that the 24-hour closure of the facility would lead to heavy traffic congestion in the airspace.The PUNCH had reported that the President, Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria, Kingsley Nwokeoma, had expressed hope that the government agency would complete the job within the stated timeframe as saying that,ƒ??Apparently, we should always have in mind that the runways are major operational facilities and if you notice, we have always had runway issues and most times you donƒ??t see the two runways being functional.ƒ??The functionality is key because it is every airlineƒ??s dream to have a runway that is not being overused. These are runways that big birds keep landing on.ƒ??The major effect will be that both the international and the local carriers will be using one particular runway, and this is not operationally healthy. Hopefully, we pray that FAAN and NAMA fix this on time and very well.ƒ?Also, a former Managing Director of Aero Contractors and ex-MD of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, Captain Ado Sanusi said, ƒ??The good thing about the Lagos airport is that it has two runways and both will not be closed at the same time. So, one is going to be in use while the other will be closed. The only negative thing is that the airlines will have to burn more fuel because thereƒ??s an increase in taxing time and since itƒ??s one runway, traffic will be a little bit more and there will be delays in the air. The airport runway lighting is something that should have been done, they resurfaced that runway, so itƒ??s something they should have done at that time.ƒ?\"\n",

    "\"There are no immediate solutions to the current crisis rocking Nigeriaƒ??s aviation sector as the cause of the major challenge in the industry is a global issue, the Federal Government declared on Tuesday.Although the government stated that it was making efforts to address the challenges, it stressed that it could not tell when the solutions to the crisis would materialise.Domestic airlines in Nigeria have been faced with a stiff challenge posed by the hike in the price of aviation fuel, popularly called JetA1.The cost of the commodity has jumped from less than N300/litre to over N800/litre within about five months.This has also warranted an increase in airfares by airlines that could manage to get the commodity, while others that could not survive the situation, such as Aero Contractors, have temporarily suspended operations.However, the airlines operating currently, have continued to delay or cancel flights due to difficultly in accessing JetA1, a development that has caused untold hardship to travellers.Reacting to the crisis in the sector at a meeting with officials of the Airline Operators of Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, stated that the government was aware of the challenges, but noted that there was no immediate solution to the concerns currently. He said, ƒ??Energy crises is real and it is global. Today there is aviation fuel problem all over the world. From America to New Zealand. It is aggravating in Nigeria because we donƒ??t produce the product.ƒ??It is aggravated also because the foreign exchange is scarce in Nigeria and the source of earning the foreign exchange has also has dwindledƒ?.

Government had in the past sourced 10,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel for domestic airlines, adding that the government was wiling to do more.ƒ??As we speak, the government is in the process of finding a permanent? solution to this issue,ƒ? Sirika stated.Outlining some of the the solutions, the minister said it would include, ƒ??importation of the product at the appropriate price, accelerating the refurbishment of our refineries and also wait for the coming on stream of Dangote Refinery to boost supply of the product.ƒ?He, however, noted that this would not happen soon.ƒ??So when you ask how soon, I wouldnƒ??t know when Dangote will come on stream, I wouldnƒ??t know how soon the refineries will be fixed. I wouldnƒ??t know when imports would become sufficient. But the government is working towards all these to happen,ƒ? Sirika stated. The minister said he would meet with relevant stakeholders including the Central Bank of Nigeria so that the airlines could access forex at the official rate rather than the black market price.The President, AON, Abdulmunaf Sarina, said the aviation fuel crises began from N180/litre, but had now jumped to N1000/litre, adding that accessing forex crises was a huge burden on the Industry.ƒ??The rate at which the dollar is escalating now is very alarming. Everyday, a difference between of N10 to N15 Naira is added at the parallel market. Last week Monday, it was N610 but today it is N670 to one dollar,ƒ? he said.On his part, the Vice President, AON, Allen Onyema, said the airlines were satisfied with the government intervention in the industry, but admitted the solution to the crisis was not in the short term.\"\n",

    "\"In recent years, thousands of Nigerians have fallen prey to the devious antics of money-doubling platforms, popularly known as Ponzi schemes. DEBORAH DAN-AWOH looks at the trend and how Nigerians are yet to learn from painful historySince the official declaration of economic recession in early 2016, Nigeria has experienced a proliferation of the worldƒ??s oldest scam, the Ponzi scheme.In the wake of the economic crunch of 2016, the Central Bank of Nigeria and the International Monetary Fund had stated that Nigeriaƒ??s economy had slipped into recession. The effect was evident through the countryƒ??s significant decline in economic activities, such as increased hardship, unemployment, low output, and rising inflationary pressures.At that juncture, some Nigerians began to seek alternative means of income via schemes that looked viable on surface value but fraught with potentially tragic consequences in the long run.Hence, when the unorthodox financial system, Mavrodi Mundial Movement, a Ponzi scheme launched in 2011 by Russian politician and conman Sergius Mavrodi, made its way to Nigeria, many Nigerians embraced it as the system that would finally help to secure their financial freedom.Historically, Ponzi schemes in Nigeria were common in the 1980s and early 1990s. The earliest in the recall were the Umana-Umana investment platform in Port Harcourt and Calabar, the Planwell scheme in Edo State, and the Nospecto in Lagos.Ponzi schemes, also known as pyramid sales schemes, are a money laundering system where investors are lured in with the promise of high returns on investment after a specified period. The system runs in a somewhat cyclic fashion by paying old investors with deposits of new investors. Usually, this cycle becomes unsustainable when the backlog of old investors eligible for payments exceeds the investments coming into the system. According to a report by Independent.co.uk, MMM swept throughout Africa with campaign promises of a ƒ??30% per monthƒ? return, including other acquirable bonuses. It reigned supreme between 2016-2017 as a mutual aid fund. In the first few months, 2.4 million people had signed up to join the scheme.The massive subscriptions to this financial system caught the attention of Nigeriaƒ??s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which confirmed that it was monitoring the scheme.In 2016, three million Nigerians lost N18bn when MMM crashed, according to Nigeriaƒ??s Securities and Exchange Commission. These and many became the fate of Nigerians who took a deep dive into the deceptive financial scheme.The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency had its hands full with suicide attempts and pleaded with Lagosians to dial their emergency numbers if they spotted anyone trying to commit suicide.According to the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum, the Nigerian investing public also lost another N11.9 billion to the MMM scheme. The CBN disclosed that investors lost N12 bn.Unfortunately, not even the disastrous outcome of the MMM scheme was able to deter Nigerians from falling prey to Ponzi schemes.In recognition of the unsustainable nature of traditional Ponzi schemes, many of these scams have evolved to masquerade their platforms either as affiliate marketing campaigns or as out-and-out investment platforms with tangible business interests capable of generating profit in the long run. Today, over the last five years, Nigerians have lost over N300bn in Ponzi schemes, according to a report generated by the Norrenberger Financial Investments scheme.When Racksterli, an investment platform introduced by Michael Chidiebere Oti, also known as Black Gold, crashed earlier this year, hundreds of Nigerians were disheartened. Adeola Olakunle, 28, was one of the victims.The platform exploited the 2020 COVID-19 crisis that forced a lot of Nigerians to search for alternative investments with significant returns.Racksterli offered an irresistible deal which was called the Racksterli Package. For example, an investment of N14,000 was a guarantee of N21,600. The highest investment category, ƒ??Topazƒ?? would earn an investor N9.3m who invested N20m. Others included Diamond, Ruby, Platinum, and Emerald, amongst others.? ƒ??It happened in January 2021. I invested 100k. To make a daily return on investment on the website. I have to log in to the site daily and share on my WhatsApp so that my ROI can increase daily; it was going well until day 15.ƒ??The website started misbehaving, we could not log in for almost two days, and later it came back. But the ROI was not increasing, and then everyone started drama of all sorts. The guy will do IG live videos to calm people and ensure their funds are safe. In summary, I lost my money.ƒ?Mrs. Olakunleƒ??s testimony is one of many victims who have fallen prey to Ponzi. 86FB or 86Z, an Abu Dhabi-based company that owns Manchester City Football Club in England, is a gambling investment platform that claims affiliations with William Hill, a global online gambling company based in London, England, and City Football Group.However, it is not listed among CFGƒ??s football business investments. A victim of the platform, Mark Henry, said he walked into the Ponzi trap hoping that he could outsmart the system and make cash before it crashed.ƒ??My best friend introduced me to it, and I thought that the best time to enter into a Ponzi scheme was in the beginning. So, I started with N10,000 and was getting 3 per cent of the money daily. But I wanted to earn more profit, so I invested N100,000. I planned that I would take out the initial investment when I doubled the money. I made a profit and withdrew, but I thought that since the platform had not crashed yet, I re-invested N200,000.ƒ??It started with payment delays. I was doing it through Binance USDT. Thatƒ??s how I was paid. They didnƒ??t pay me for three days, and? the withdrawal process was cancelled. I made about N500,000 that I couldnƒ??t withdraw, and I lost over N100,000.ƒ?Binomo Investment is another fraud trap engineered by Ponzi masterminds, but yet again, numerous Nigerians fell for it.Another victim, Israel Olaire, said that he ventured into it because of his close friend whom he trusted.? ƒ??It was one of my close friends that introduced the scheme to me, though he was also a new participant.ƒ? Related News SEC vows crackdown on Ponzi schemes, illegal fund managers Eavesdropper: Before investing in ponzi schemes SEC warns Nigerians against Ponzi schemes According to Olaire, his friend assured him the platform was legitimate.ƒ??That was the first time in my life to do such a thing. It happened in 2019; my friend introduced me to the man, and the minimum investment was N100,000, but I started with N300,000. According to the platform, it will take 21 days to one month to get my capital and interest. I was supposed to get 20-30 per cent interest. The Binomo platform was a trading system.ƒ??The week I was to get my profit was when the trouble started. They said the gateway for payment had a problem, and thatƒ??s how they delayed my payout till it dawned on me that I had been scammed. I almost attempted suicide.ƒ?According to experts, Ponzi schemes are not difficult to detect, but due to the get-rich-quick syndrome, many have been led to the slaughter table of swindlers.The Former President, Institute of Software Providers of Nigeria, ISPON and Director-General, Delta State Innovation Hub, Chris Uwaje, said that? Ponzi schemes were like phishing that clamped down on gullible individuals. ƒ??They put a hook because they know people are gullible. People look at the information without checking for the authenticity of the platforms.ƒ??It is the gullible aspect of humanity that is being exploited.ƒ?ƒ??If there is one way to identify Ponzi schemes, it is that they have no official registration. For instance, a bank says it will give you 300 per cent interest, but people will take everything without verifying. What makes a bank authentic? A bank must be registered; it must have an address; it must have a license from the Central Bank, and must have insurance. ƒ??The susceptible nature of individuals has driven government intervention such as a lottery. The lottery system is straightforward and regulated.Individuals should ask questions before engaging with any platform.ƒ?Uwaje told The PUNCH that the recent success of bitcoin had made people embrace these risky ventures. ƒ??People delve into cryptocurrency bitcoins, and they are not registered. They just evolved digitally, and people believe in them. So, people lose money, and people make money. But the best way, as I said, is the authentication process.ƒ?According to Uwaje, commerce was governed by innovation, labour, and reward. ƒ??You donƒ??t just put money and expect millions. It is not authentic.ƒ?He explained that technology and data availability had made it easier for Ponzi scammers. ƒ??Then the fluidity of the online data, what they call the big data, is driving fake authentication.ƒ?Also speaking, Emeka Orijani, a Cyber security expert and CTO of NAJLO, said identifying Ponzi traps was quite easy, noting that ƒ??every website has a register, a footprint online. Someone is telling you to put N5000 and make N50m. If you check when it was registered, you would find out it was launched three days ago. This is a red flag.ƒ??Another way is to ask Google about the websiteƒ??s legitimacy and it will pull out news and information about the site.ƒ? Orijani said that continuous sensitisation must be put in place as well as regulations to curb this menace.ƒ??For instance, crypto and NFT are being bought and sold for a whopping sum of money. Yet it is powered by volatile demand and supply. Greed is a major factor to why people fall victim.ƒ?However, the Director of Research and Strategy at Chapel Hill Denham, Tajudeen Ibrahim, had a different perspective on why victims fell for Ponzi advances.Ibrahim blamed ƒ??high poverty and unemployment rates in Nigeriaƒ? as major culprits.ƒ??There are also, low financial education in Nigeria and few investment products that are appealing to retail investors.ƒ?Uwaje accentuated the need for a verification platform to build a community as well as influencers to drive the narrative of the dangers of Ponzi schemes.ƒ??We need sociologists to educate people to avoid these traps, thatƒ??s where actors and entertainment come in to sensitise the public about Ponzi schemes.ƒ? Against the backdrop of the thriving illegal financial schemes, the Federal Government, in collaboration with SEC and CBN, has implemented strategies to prohibit these activities.Recall that the House of Representatives passed for second reading, a bill to repeal and re-enact the Nigerian Capital market, Investments, and Securities Act.The bill seeks, among other things, to prohibit Ponzi schemes and other pyramid investments.The CBN and the SEC have championed campaigns against Ponzi schemes and collaborated with security operatives to tackle perpetrators.However, their efforts have proven futile as more Ponzi schemes spring up.When contacted, the spokesperson of the SEC, Efe Ebelo, declined to comment on the ongoing plans of the commission to further clamp down on illegal schemes.\"\n",

    "\"The Federal Government on Monday announced that it had approved a ban on the direct purchase of agricultural produce from local farmers by foreign merchants.It said the decision was taken because most foreign merchants who purchased agro-commodities at farm-gate prices in Nigeria were taking advantage of local farmers with respect to the payments made for such produce.The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Abubakar Mahmood, who disclosed this while responding to questions at the 4th Women Enterprise Alliance Conference in Abuja, said the Federal Executive Council approved the ban.He said, ƒ??On allowing foreigners to buy produce from farmers at farm-gate prices, about a month ago or two we were able to get a memo approved by the Federal Government through the Federal Executive Council on this issue.ƒ??So no foreign merchant will come and buy at farm-gate prices.

    "\"As the ongoing industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities continues to render many undergraduates redundant, DEBORAH DAN-AWOH takes a look at salient lessons that students can adopt to achieve financial freedom before calling time on their academic programmes.in the last five months, Nigerian undergraduates in government-owned varsities have seen their educational pursuit come to a screeching halt due to an industrial action embarked upon by lecturers owing to a long list of reasons, chief among which is the funding of public universities, or lack thereof.But, this in itself, is no news, as the phenomenon of industrial action by university teachers is almost as old as the nation. It is an ugly reality that frequently rears its head on such a regular basis that it has become par-for-the-course as far as the Nigerian education system goes.As a matter of fact, the issue of strike action, notably by ASUU, has been so deeply entrenched in Nigeriaƒ??s educational system that now fewer than 20 months have been lost in the last five years due to the unending tussle between the government and the varsity lecturers.For students, getting caught in the crosshairs of this fight between two elephants always echoes as a very disconcerting experience, since every undergraduate typically dreams of graduating in record time in order to move on to the next chapter of life. However, if meticulously and intentionally harnessed, the downtime occasioned by these frequent industrial actions could be parlayed into a dress rehearsal on how to achieve financial freedom before entering the unpredictable labour market.As a matter of fact, given the situation of the present economy, it goes without saying that establishing the framework for attaining financial freedom before graduating from the university will likely increase any young personƒ??s chances of building a successful career.This is in view of the fact the fleeting nature of life itself most times makes the transition from being a student (who has all his needs taken care of) to having to face a vast new world of providing for oneself can unfold so quickly that one has a great difficulty adapting to the changes that come with it. As such, setting up a side hustle before graduating from the university becomes a much-needed intermission that helps the students to cushion the changes that come with this new world.Perhaps, the side hustles can translate into life-long careers as financial ignorance has dominated the minds of many. This is probably due to the perspective that university time is a period of finding passion, refining the path, partying, falling in love, adventure, and exploration.However, the financial decisions or any choice individuals make compound by 20 per cent, according to the Wall Street Brothers in their book entitled, ƒ??Efficiency.ƒ?Especially as the searing realities of the Nigerian economy have dampened the visions and aspirations of many University students.? Ifeoluwa Oladapo, a 24-year-old undergraduate at the University of Lagos, said she had high expectations upon entering school. Still, it seemed like her life had been put on hold by the strike.ƒ??Honestly, I am just tired of the whole thing. I miss school, getting extra income from uncles and aunties. Right now, I am studying Marine Biology, yet I am an entrepreneur who specialises in cakes and pastries; which is the one thing that has kept me sane. Then, I also help run our family restaurant when I donƒ??t have orders to fill for pastries.ƒ?According to Oladapo, one of her best decisions was learning to bake while waiting for admission into the university. ƒ??I thank God I learned to bake then; raising funds wasnƒ??t easy. But I thank God for my family that supported me then. If not, I would have been at the mercy of this country financially.ƒ?Oladapo explained that saving the profits from her business and reinvesting to buy other types of equipment had also yielded interest.ƒ??I can now charge higher because I understand how much I have invested personally to achieve this level of professionalism. Even though I make good money, I donƒ??t squander it on frivolous things. I only buy what I need and then save the rest.ƒ?Speaking further on money lessons undergraduates could learn during the ASUU strike, Stepanie Anene, an undergraduate studying Mass Communications at the National Open University, said that her career in voice-over as a professional had opened doors for her financially.? According to her, the first financial lesson she learned was that to make money, one must not have to follow the path chosen in school.

I was intrigued; I didnƒ??t know anything about pricing then, so whatever they offered, I accepted it.ƒ? Although still in school, Anene revealed that she worked from the confines of her house and made thousands of naira from her craft as a freelancer.ƒ??Having started this in 2019, I received direct messages from people in Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, and the United States. It was then I realised that, just like me, many people want to break free from the box society or education has put them.ƒ??So, one thing I tell people is to start, anyhow, anywhere. Take the first step and watch it unfold. Every month, I get nothing less than N100,000 from voice-over jobs as an undergraduate.ƒ??When people ask me how they can start making money for themselves or feel limited because of the course they are studying, I tell them that it doesnƒ??t matter. As a doctor, you can become a comedian and be amazed at how your life will turn out.ƒ?According to Anene,? only few people studied what they were passionate about in a country like Nigeria. ƒ??As long as you desire to make a side income, you can delve into any field,ƒ? she said.Given the technological disruption and Nigeriaƒ??s backward movement against the tide of innovation and advancement, setting long-term goals to make knowledge and skills investments will ensure that young people are valuable enough to get future jobs and secure financial freedom.? Marvelous Eniwaye, a 100-level student of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, said that the strike ƒ??has dampened my zeal towards my studies. I had intentions to venture into several educational stuff before the strike, but the strike has been a hurdle against my intention.

Iƒ??m learning UI/UX design, although I am just coasting since I donƒ??t have a personal system. I use the shopƒ??s system sometimes since I donƒ??t need some special applications.ƒ?As it stands, the rhythm of skill acquisition and implementation has changed. Even though the nation takes a back seat in the scheme of things, young people can embrace the new change and the future of work to remedy the poverty gap.While some undergraduates are leveraging the strike to create building blocks for a secured financial future, other students who havenƒ??t imbibed this culture must begin to make hay while the sun shines, experts have advised.Dr. Udu Yakubu, biographer and publisher, May University Press Limited, told The PUNCH that despite the economic situation, students of universities should understand that every phase of life would pass quickly.ƒ??Money lessons for the undergraduates is that upon getting part-time jobs, you canƒ??t rule out the possibility of getting free money from parents and loved ones.ƒ?Whatever it is, the point to underscore is the need for students to be enterprising whether they are still in school or out of school. Yakubu said white-collar jobs had become past news.ƒ??There arenƒ??t many jobs out there. Being enterprising means that with their degree or qualification, if they are thrown into the labour market, they can do many things for themselves, if they have learned how to manage the little resources that have come their way.ƒ?Undergraduates must understand the essence of being financially independent.

Europe is no longer buying fuel from Russia, so they have to do with what they have.? As you can see, the pump price of PMS has gone up in Europe itself.ƒ??The consequence for us is that what we would have used as proceeds is what we are using to import back PMS to the country for local consumption. The same thing goes for aviation; the JET A-1 that is being imported is beyond what our country is consuming. Nigerians are smuggling JET A-1 to other West African countries. So, it means neighbouring countries live on what Nigeria is bringing in and that accounts for why the subsidy keeps increasing.ƒ??The people doing this bunker and stealing of our resources arenƒ??t ordinary Nigerians. They are rich and powerful people who have become cabals; they do this stealing in very large quantities. How can anybody justify that 80 per cent of what we produce is stolen?ƒ? Related News JET A1 crisis: Operators fear industry collapse, job losses No immediate solution to aviation crisis ƒ?? FG JetA1: Prepare for flight disruptions, airlines tell passengers The lawmaker further lamented that it was painful as it was further hampering the economy of the country.He added, ƒ??But what can we do when the refineries are not working. The concern of everyone is to make the refineries work and build one or two more refineries.ƒ??When the refineries are not working, these are the consequences and more so with the global economic recession, the recession will first manifest in the aviation industry and that is because people are now traveling more by air than before.ƒ??Also, our own inability to make refineries work and the devaluation of the naira are making it difficult for airlines to get the Jet A-1 and once itƒ??s not available, then there is no way people can move. And it may continue for a while. And apart from the importation business, aviation is a major driver of the economy.ƒ??Many people cannot go by road because of the security state of the nation. And as it is today, the airlines are finding it hard to procure servicing parts because of the cost. I think again, like I said, aviation is very important to the socio-economic development of any nation. Ours is more serious because it is crude, so until we get the refineries working, we cannot think of the other solutions to the aviation industry.ƒ?Adeyemi noted that the good news, however, was that there was rehabilitation work going on at the Port Harcourt Refinery and the Senate Committee on Petroleum Downstream, will be visiting the place next week to look at the refineries.\"\n",

So, when you add the two together you will find out that there was an increase in the cost of power.ƒ??Two, the foreign exchange availability was reduced significantly. Therefore, people became desperate to replace their inventory. Therefore, it is not surprising that businesses are under pressure and their margins are being compressed. The point is that with the cumulative effect of the decadence and adequate pricing, the cost of producing electricity is much more than what the tariff is giving them. Therefore, unfortunately, every day they produce they are moving closer and closer to their collapse. Because in economics, you produce where your marginal revenue is equal to your marginal cost, but here, the marginal cost is higher than the marginal revenue. That is the basic rule of economics and that is happening in the electricity market. And for the foreign exchange market, the supply of forex fro basic inventory is not available and, therefore, the more unavailable it is the more people have to buy forex at a prohibitive cost. So, cumulatively, all of these things are leading to a massive increase.ƒ?Also speaking, a member of the Nigerian economic Summit Group, Dr, Ikenna Nwaosu, said, ƒ??This has been spoken by so many people and even if i should speak, I will be speaking like a broken record.

    "\"Operators of the new marginal oil fields are expected to earn significant revenue from the fields, OPEOLUWANI AKINTAYO reportsProposed crude oil exploration from 57 marginal oil fields is expected to boost Nigeriaƒ??s oil production by at least 8.835 million barrels monthly, an analysis by The PUNCH has shown.With the newly issued marginal field licences, the countryƒ??s oil production is expected to grow by 285, 000 barrels per day, going by the estimated 5,000bpd output projected for each field.As a result, operators of the new marginal oil field licences are estimated to rake in at least N364bn ($883,500,000) monthly if the oil price remains stable above $100/barrel for a long time.? Already, experts have predicted that oil prices may remain above $100 per barrel zone over the next one year.Going by the analysis, the operators of the fields may rake in about N4.368tn in a year in the absence of external factors such as the activities of oil vandals, and production shutdown, among others.However, the additional 8.835 million barrels per month is expected to go a long way in boosting the nationƒ??s oil production.A marginal oil field is described as any field with oil and gas reserves, booked and reported annually to the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, but remains explored for a period of over 10 years. The marginal oil field programme was introduced to encourage increased indigenous participation in the Nigerian petroleum sector and grow the countryƒ??s crude oil and gas reserves.Each field is expected to produce at least 5000 barrels of oil per day at the initial exploration stage.However, it is expected that production could grow to 10,000b/d and as high as 25,000b/d, depending on the viability of the field and the readiness of investors to pump in more funds.The Federal Government has been yearning to see the nationƒ??s oil reserves and daily production rise to 40 billion and three million barrels respectively.The government believes the 57 marginal oil fields won last year by 161 companies will boost the nationƒ??s reserves and production.The 2020 marginal oil field bid round started in June of the same year. In May, 2021, 161 companies were shortlisted as winners of the 57 marginal fields which were put on offer.The offers spanned onshore, swamp and shallow water. The marginal oil field licences were handed over to the winners of the bids last month by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission. Some of the companies which emerged winners from the exercise included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.Others were: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil and Virgin Forest, among others.However, despite efforts to encourage indigenous players,? marginal oil fields are yet to make any significant impact in the Nigerian oil and gas industry and are currently accounting for less than four per cent of the countryƒ??s crude oil output. Related News FG rakes in over N2tn from marginal oil fields sale 57 successful investors get marginal oil field licences Tuesday ƒ??FG 33 successful bidders lose FGƒ??s marginal oil-field awards Experts have said Nigeriaƒ??s low crude oil output is putting a strain on its revenue and ultimately the countryƒ??s general economy that relies heavily on revenue from oil.In 2003, twenty-four marginal fields were allocated to 31 indigenous companies, however, as of 2016; only seven were producing, contributing approximately one per cent to Nigeriaƒ??s daily oil production.Exactly a decade after the award of the first programme, another licensing round was announced in 2013 with 31 fields on offer.The country has also consistently missed its OPEC quota due to low crude oil production. Economic and financial experts have however reacted to the development.ƒ??Beyond OPEC, Nigeriaƒ??s economy will continue to face local pressure as a result of the Russian/Ukraine war. Although oil prices are high, we are unable to produce enough oil to increase our revenue, and that is putting a lot of pressure on our external reserves and exchange rateƒ?, Chief Executive Officer at Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu told The PUNCH during an interview.According to an oil and gas expert, Bala Zaka, the issuance of the licences may not boost the nationƒ??s economy significantly.ƒ??The licence issuance has already been delayed for over one year, so there is no way it can benefit the country, because if the licences had been issued earlier, the winners would have started work. They would have added to the dwindling oil and gas production of the country.Some of these awardees would have also borrowed loans. Donƒ??t forget, Nigeriaƒ??s currency has witnessed serious devaluation, and most of them may not be able to afford paying up, many of them would have even returned the loans, while some would have moved onto other businesses.ƒ?Zaka, however, advised the bid winners not to delay exploration any further if they hope to take advantage of the boom in oil price.If holders of the newly issued 57 marginal oil fields spring into action immediately, oil production is expected to begin in 2023. Brent International hit $104 per barrel 8pm on SundayThe former Group Chairman/CEO, International Energy Services Limited, Dr. Diran Fawibel, advised the NUPRC to make sure that all the processes were properly streamlined to enable the licensees to begin operations immediately.He said, ƒ??The Upstream Petroleum Commission needs to deepen their engagement with the authority, and make sure all the processes are streamlined, and the operators will not have any problem. Once they are given their licences, we expect them to go into operations quickly. The government wants to improve the oil production through the marginal fields as you know that our production figure has been lagging behind, and we donƒ??t meet the OPEC quota. The government is now looking to the independent and marginal field operators to improve their operations and increase production level. If the oil companies are not making investments, we expect the marginal field operators to put their acts together and fund the development of the fields. We hope it wonƒ??t be that they just take the permits and sit on them because it will be a big tragedy for the country. It is better late than never. These operators should go full blast and within a short time, about 12-18 months, some of the streams should come on stage and add to crude oil production.ƒ?According to a professor of Economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Tella Sheriffdeen, there is no short-term solution to the countryƒ??s low crude oil production.ƒ??There is no short-term solution to the low crude oil output because thereƒ??s nothing we can do at the moment to increase it. We will just have to keep bearing the revenue loss. The only thing is that the Federal Government needs to plan for the long term by looking for ways to increase production,ƒ? he said.\"\n",

    "\"Queues for Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, will end when the Federal Government halts PMS import monopoly of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited and stops subsidy on petrol, the President, Petroleum Retail Outlet Owners Association of Nigeria, Billy Gillis-Harry posits, in this interview with Okechukwu NnodimWhat exactly is the major problem in the downstream sector, because we still see queues at filling stations, especially in Abuja and environs?The problem is that every side needs to be transparent. We as retail outlet owners, we are ready to sell petroleum products to the teeming Nigerian public. We have no reason not to sell our products. Every single money that is used to buy 145,000 litres of PMS, almost N7m, is loaned and is time-bound. So every retail outlet owner knows that the right thing to do business-wise is to sell the products and try to turn around that sale as many times as possible. So with that scenario in view, there is no retail outlet owner that is hoarding product or giving it out through diversion. Yes, we know there will be bad eggs among the good bunch, but the fact that we are not having sufficient products is what is still the cause. But in the case of Abuja, it is clear to understand that if the bridging claims are paid to marketers, they can be able to recycle their product purchase cycles. That is just the reality.So the payment of bridging claims is still an issue and insufficient supply is also an issue. If there are products and there is money for us to buy, why wouldnƒ??t we buy and sell? What else are we in business for? Are we going to buy products and keep it? The answer is no. So that is the reality and I have explained this non-stop for weeks now. Now, to lay emphasis on the case in Abuja, why should there even be queues in Abuja? I mean when you have fuel queues in Abuja, it tells the world that something is wrong in Nigeria. Thatƒ??s the capital of the country and then you go to Lagos you see queues appearing and disappearing, Kaduna is almost not having products in their retail outlets on many occasions. It is simply a situation of demand overwhelming supply. The supply process is not efficient to meet the needs and the increasing demand for petrol.The NNPC often says it has enough products. But going by your position, is it that NNPCƒ??s claims are not true?Clearly if there are products, then it should be delivered. However, I do know that the authority is doing their best to make sure that everywhere is monitored and marketers are encouraged to sell products at the approved pump price. So if there are no products at the retail outlets then, that is why there will be queues. Therefore this clearly shows that demand is currently overwhelming supply in some cities including Abuja. The rule is supposed to be that there must be about 30 days sufficiency in Nigeria. NNPC is the only importer of petrol. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority will only know what it has approved in terms of the quality and quantity test of what has been imported. For products in storage they also would know, because from what has been delivered through the tank farms, there are records. But they (NMDPRA) canƒ??t be held for NNPCƒ??s inadequacies, because if NNPC says its has 30 days sufficiency in terms of supply, you cannot hold the downstream regulator for that, neither can you hold the retailers for it. This is because the retailers will only sell when we are given products. We are not importing, we are not manufacturing, thereƒ??s no refinery that is working.Is there a solution to this? The solution is simple. The subsidy that is being paid should be stopped. The money should be recycled into other developmental projects such as health, refineries, etc. Since the refineries have not been successfully fixed by the government, they should either give it wholly to private sector practitioners such as PETROAN, that own the retail outlets for which the products are being refined, to manage. Or they should allow us to import petroleum products and sell at the market-determined price, which is why we are saying that deregulation is the only answer to these incessant problems where the government will on one hand be explaining something, while on the other hand, practitioners will be saying something else. So let NNPC not be the sole importer of PMS into Nigeria. Thatƒ??s the solution. And let (forex) foreign exchange be made available to marketers and companies that have facilities to be able to import and sell at the prevailing market price. That is just the solution. Related News Subsidy probe: Reps say 23 oil firms unknown Nigeriaƒ??s illicit romance with subsidy Reps kick as stakeholders shun subsidy probe Therefore as far as we are concerned, what we as an association can do is to get the government to work with us in making sure our refineries are working and that they are efficient. And we as businessmen know how to do that much better. Government really has no business being in business. So that is why we are saying, deregulate fully and then privatise the refineries and allow PETROAN to work with you to do part ownership of the refineries to make them efficient. This is because whatever you are refining, is it not for our retail outlets? So we are the ones you are refining for, and then for onward transmission to Nigerians to use as the last mile of distribution.There is this concern that if subsidy is removed, petrol might sell above N500/litre. Are marketers not concerned about this?This subsidy that we are talking about, what is its practical performance in the every day life of a Nigerian? We need to ask that question. Today you bought petrol at N250/litre, somebody else bought at N300/litre, while another person is saying let us just have the product because we are ready to pay N400/litre. So you can see that in different parts of the country there are different kinds of experience by motorists and other users of petrol. Therefore it is a very simple thing that we should level the ground by allowing deregulation to rule. Thatƒ??s the answer.Considering the above concerns, why should an investor be interested in investing in Nigeriaƒ??s oil sector?An investor should be interested in Nigeriaƒ??s oil and gas industry, first, for the size of oil and gas production that we are capable of making possible in Nigeria. Two, the consumption. We are over 200 million Nigerians consuming different energy products from petrol to kerosene to gas. So we have the market. Third is that Nigeria provides a very excellent high return on investment value because of the cost of labour in this country that is not in any way impacting negatively on the investors for profit making. This, however, does not mean that there are no other challenges in the sector. For us as practical operators in the industry, our greatest challenge is finding funds and ensuring that regulators do not over-charge us, which is what we are seeing now. But in terms of raw materials and human resources, there is actually very little or no challenge because we have it in abundance across the country. We are not lacking in raw materials, rather we are just lacking in competent technology and know-how.So are businesses thriving as expected in the sector? This depends on the arm of the sector because we have downstream, midstream and upstream. In the upstream, there is no doubting the fact that you need to be there for at least two years to be able to start producing crude oil or gas that is of commercial value. In the midstream, you need to also be there for at least one full year and half. In the downstream, which consists of the retail outlets and logistics, of course, if you put a filling station of N80m in a location where you are having products to sell at an average of maybe 30,000 litres daily, you should be able to break even within seven months.This again speaks to the high prospects in this industry and I can tell you why. Every time you hear about electric motors, solar power, or alternative energy, yes we need them but you cannot compare their quality with the quality of energy being generated from fossil fuels. So it means that there is a future. Therefore in five years, the possibility of our oil production increasing above three million barrels per day is likely. In 10 years we can start to look at how to domesticate our business effectively and run our own economy in this country, where we can be able to drill, explore, refine and export.\"\n",

He said the reports would come in by the time the parliament resumes in September.Presently, there are tens of investigations embarked upon by the House, some of which are public assets and revenue losses, with the committees in charge failing to report back.One of them is the Ad Hoc Committee on Power Sector Reforms, charged with the responsibility of undertaking a holistic review of the power sector in Nigeria and recommending appropriate legislative actions. The panel has yet to lay its report.Gbajabiamila, at the inauguration of the committee on June 9, 2020, had stated that there is no going back on the move to end estimated billing, also referred to as ƒ??crazy billƒ??, being charged by distribution companies. The Speaker stated that setting up the committee, chaired by the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, became necessary due to a resolution by the House to ensure a comprehensive review of all legislation relating to the power sector.It is also about two years since the House raised the alarm over ƒ??dangerousƒ? clauses in loan and commercial agreements with international bodies and other countries, especially China, but the probe into the commercial agreements has become inconclusive.The House Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreements, chaired by Nicholas Ossai, which was conducting the investigation, held its last public activity on the matter on August 18, 2020, when it suspended its investigative hearing.

He had decried that despite the dwindling revenue of the country, several abandoned capital projects litter every state of the federation.Also on the list of abandoned probes is that of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Need to Review the Purchase, Use and Control of Arms, Ammunition and Related Hardware by Military, Paramilitary and Other Law Enforcement Agencies in Nigeria, chaired by Olaide Akinremi.The National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Monguno (retd.), had in March 2021 alleged that $1bn funds meant for the purchase of arms to tackle insurgency during the ex-service chiefsƒ?? tenure got missing. Monguno, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation early that Friday, alleged that neither the funds nor the weapons the ex-service chiefs were meant to buy could be traced. He added that the Nigeria Governorsƒ?? Forum was also wondering where all the funds meant for arms went. According to him, the President will soon order a probe into the matter.The NSA would later in a statement issued by his office recant his earlier allegations, saying he was quoted out of context.

    "\"As Nigeria prepares for its 5G rollout in August, Temitayo Jaiyeola speaks to Vice President, Global Telecommunications Industry, IBM, Craig Wilson, on the possibilities, challenges, and affordability of this new technology, and how Nigerians will benefit from itA lot has been said about the potential of 5G. With your experience in the industry, how will 5G transform Nigeriaƒ??s digital economy?The immediate opportunity for 5G in Nigeriaƒ??s digital economy is to use Fixed Wireless Access to bridge the gap in enhanced broadband connectivity for homes and enterprises, both large and small. Key sectors in the region that could benefit include manufacturing, agriculture, financial services and oil and gas industries. An important benefit of 5G is that it enables open ecosystems to thrive. Open, cloud-native architectures and operating models will allow Nigeria to develop a vibrant local ecosystem that can help drive innovation and economic development. 5G growth in the region is expected to develop rapidly in the second half of the decade and continue into the 2030s. The economic impact of mid-band 5G will be around 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2030 in Sub-Saharan Africa.Since 4G rolled out, penetration has peaked at around 40 percent in the nation. Will the uptake of 5G perform better than this? How can operators roll out this network in an effective way?GSMA Intelligence believes 4G will remain dominant, with 5G connections making up only 3% of total mobile connections in Africa by 2025.The roll-out of 5G will be carried out in phases, beginning in urban areas with a need for high-quality broadband, and Nigeria expects to have 5G coverage of major cities by 2025, according to Nigeria Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Isa Pantami. The International Telecommunication Union said regional governments must streamline regulatory conditions to facilitate 5G deployment, providing regulatory flexibility for innovative 5G propositions and addressing the consumer barriers to adoption ƒ?? both of which will contribute to effective rollout.Nigeria has a big Internet access gap, is 5G primed to bridge this gap? For 5g to have an impact on the? continent, how much investment is from a continental perspective? A sweeping majority of Nigerians ƒ?? 88 per cent ƒ?? lack access to smartphones with 4G-like speeds for Internet connection and the capacity to use the Internet on a daily basis, according to the Alliance for Affordable Internet. Based on the access and backhaul infrastructure available in the country, a model for the deployment of 5G services in urban, suburban and rural environments must be developed. Today, 4G network services are only available in urban areas, so a continued investment toward rural areas is essential. A phased 5G network rollout, starting from operational fibre optic and microwave node locations, is recommended for an impactful transition. Today, Ethiopia, Botswana, Egypt, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe are all testing or deploying 5G. Nigeria issued spectrum licenses in March, and is hoping to possess the widest 5G network in the continent this year. The Nigerian Communications Commission has indicated that it is targeting August 2022 for commercial deployment.How will 5G accelerate the fourth industrial revolution on the continent and in Nigeria?The most impactful benefit of 5G is by creating an underlying platform that enables existing technologies to be deployed in new and better ways, for example IoT. While the claims that 5G will usher in the fourth industrial revolution are bold, they are indeed possible. Opportunities in agriculture and healthcare are key verticals where 5G will enable significant transformation in both operating cost models and in the ability to introduce exciting new innovations that were not previously possible.With 5G, seamless online actions are set to create more data traffic from the continent. What are some of the security challenges this might pose? Related News Internet: Two telcos invest N443bn in 4G, 5G 615 million 5G devices launched in 2021 ƒ?? Report 5G: FG approves Microsoft Enterprise deal, others The move to 5G networks and distributed architectures introduces a few cybersecurity challenges to be addressed, including: Expanded threat surface across a hybrid cloud network, with a vast number of distributed end points that need to be secured; complexity and scale heightening the need for AI and automation to be infused across the security landscape; a shortage of cybersecurity skills and personnel. The best way to safeguard against these inherent challenges is for 5G Operators to ƒ??design inƒ? security across every part of their organisation, with modern DevSecOps methods and CI/CD processes.? Faster Internet will create a better backbone for Over The Top services such as WhatsApp calls, chats, and more, threatening traditional revenue streams of telcos. What can telcos do to create new revenue streams?Telcos must use the move to 5G and cloud native technologies to regain control of their business and their architectures. A study last year by the IBM Institute of Business Value found that a majority of high performing telecom operators expect to continue to outperform the industry by adopting secure, open hybrid cloud architectures and ecosystems to capture ƒ??platform control pointsƒ? consistent with digital businesses. There have been questions raised on the affordability of 5G. Is this a legitimate concern?The cost of a 5G device currently runs around? $350 USD, making them unafforadble for many. However, some device manufacturers have commited to bringing costs down to around $150 USD. Still, many industry analysts believe that 5G devices need to be at about $50 USD to support mass adoption across Africa. The high cost of 5G phones is a major impediment, and it impacts the launch the fifth generation network on a commercial scale when there are not enough mobile devices capable of receiving it. We can see the effects on 5G rollout when we compare Africa to other continents. Globally, the rollout of 5G has been in process since 2019. Yet deployment across Africa has been much slower, with only 6 African countries having launched the network.? COVID has made digital the new normal on the continent, how prepared is Africa, and Nigeria? And what are the key lessons if the continent is to leverage this new normal?While Africa has been hit hard by the COVID pandemic, workers and enterprises have responded to the challenges with great resilience and adaptability. However, the pandemic fundamentally altered where and how people work, upending many long-standing norms and practices. One of the most prevalent changes to training and collaboration has been the growth of digital training courses, which have been adopted by more than half of enterprises. The three key takeaways to leverage this new normal are: The first is the deregulation to accelerate the growth of large firms. The growth of large firms increases a countryƒ??s resilient economic transformation. With more assets, they are inherently more resilient and are better equipped to endure economic storms. Policymakers should prioritize policies for facilitating the entrance and growth of such firms, through domestic deregulation and encouraging foreign direct investment.? The second one is agricultural productivity-led growth and the development of the agro-food system. A second strategy leading to increased resilience and transformation is to improve agricultural productivity-led growth and the development of the agro-food system. The third is the support for smaller businesses. Globally, small businesses have been hit the hardest by the pandemic. Those businesses that are best able to adapt to digital ways of working (including remote work) and that are more insulated from global supply chain constraints are in a better position to rebound. Additionally, the ability to improve productivity or reduce cost through cloud based ƒ??as a Serviceƒ? consumption of compute and connectivity has benefitted many sectors of the economy ƒ?? both large and small.What are some of the efforts IBM is making to improve the telecommunication industry on the continent?There are a few significant efforts IBM is making in Africa to support telecom development, including Digital4Agriculture Initiative. IBMƒ??s Digital4Agriculture Initiative (D4Ag) aims to foster African start-ups in the agricultural sector and strengthen the long-term living conditions of local small farmers by increasing productivity and quality. With the help of digital expertise from IBM Services and access to accurate weather data provided by IBMƒ??s The Weather Company, D4Ag is helping over 36 African agricultural companies better prepare for the digital future. Another one is satellite towers. IBM is working with a global business partner to introduce AI based solutons to reduce cell tower energy costs and improve sustainability. We are working with a large regional telecom operator to pilot this solution in Africa. The other one is micro-lending via Blockchain. In many emerging markets, food retailers along with smallholder farmers, struggle to secure loans and develop a credit history. And without the proper financing, scaling a business is nearly impossible. To tackle this, IBM has rolled out a pilot withh Kenya-based food logistics startup, Twiga Foods, to facilitate micro-lending options for food vendors using blockchain.Increasing data traffic is inspiring a rise in the number of data centres in Nigeria and Africa. What level of new growth is expected in the data centre sector? Is Africa primed for fullscale local cloud hosting capabilities? Technologies such as the cloud, big data, and IoT generate more data through high-end applications and need more efficient systems for data processing. These technologies are growing the demand for advanced IT infrastructure in the African data center market. Enterprises prefer servers that can reduce space in the data center environment without affecting performance. The competition between branded and ODM server suppliers will continue because multiple enterprises opt for server infrastructure based on open community designs (OCP). The increasing demand for server shipments will continue to grow moderately as enterprises move to the cloud or colocation platforms for their IT infrastructure operations. The data centre market in Africa has attracted significant investments in recent years, led by Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt and Ethiopia. Global cloud service providers, including IBM, are expanding their presence with new cloud regions. In fact, more than nine data centres in Africa have added as much as 30,000 square feet or more of additional space each in 2021. Several local governments are supporting these initiatives by developing special economic zones, and industrial parks, which provide tax exemptions for data center development.\"\n",
    "\"The World Bank Group has said that Nigeriaƒ??s human capital development ranks among the worst globally.The Washington-based bank stated this in a new report titled, ƒ??COVID-19 and Nigeriaƒ??s human capital crisis,ƒ? where it noted that Nigeriaƒ??s ambitious poverty-reduction targets hinge on developing human capital.According to the report, learning poverty, which captures 10-year-oldsƒ?? ability to understand simple sentences or perform basic numeracy tasks, likely proliferated in Nigeria during the pandemic.While learning poverty cannot be estimated directly for Nigeria due to lack of data, it now affects up to 70 per cent of children in low- and middle-income countries, the World Bank notes.The report read in part, ƒ??Even prior to COVID-19, Nigeria had some of the worst human capital outcomes in the world.

Nigerians themselves favour expanding in-person learningƒ??especially by adding more hours to the school dayƒ??to help children catch up.According to a child education expert, Emmanuella Chinelo, the assertion of the World Bank on Nigeriaƒ??s learning poverty rate is not unconnected to why most Nigerian adults are unable to reach their full learning potential, which ultimately translates to the poor human capital development statistics.She, however, noted that in very rare cases, a childƒ??s inability to reach full learning potential before the age of 10 might not produce the conventional effects seen in most people who fall into that bracketShe said, ƒ??Actually. It is not always the case, even though the right thing for parents to do is to have learning support systems for their kids, because if they donƒ??t do that, most of them struggle.

The International Monetary Fund recently said the fear of political resistance, widespread corruption and pressure from interested groups were hampering the removal of the fuel subsidy in Nigeria.In the first five months, Nigeria spent N1.27tn on petrol subsidy, with a plan to spend N4tn this year.It was also disclosed that Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited would continue to fund the N4.19tn fuel subsidies for the 2022 fiscal year on behalf of the federation despite being a commercial venture and its stance of no longer remitting any money to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee for sharing to the three tiers of government monthly.The increasing cost of fuel subsidy is projected to persist amid declining revenues and rising debts.According to a recent PUNCH report, the FAAC allocation to the federal, state and local governments declined to 2.18tn between January and March 2022 when compared to the N2.24tn disbursed in the preceding quarter, Q4 2021.The Debt Management Office recently disclosed that Nigeriaƒ??s total public debt stock increased to N41.60tn in the first quarter of 2022 from N39.56tn as of December 2021, showing an increase of N2.04tn within a period of three months.

It was disclosed the Federal Governmentƒ??s total revenue for the period was N1.63tn, while debt service gulped N1.94tn.The IMF has also said that Nigeria will likely depend on overdrafts from the Central Bank of Nigeria to fund its proposed petrol subsidy bill.The finance minister has also said that Federal Government was planning to tap ƒ?ª2bn ($2.2bn) of the money it raised in a Eurobond sale last year and targets more local borrowing in 2022 to help fund fuel subsidy.The World Bank recently warned that increasing fuel subsidy puts the Nigerian economy at a high risk as subsidy payments could significantly impact public finance and pose debt sustainability concerns.Atiku slams FGMeanwhile, the presidential candidate of the People Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has said that Thursdayƒ??s revelation by Ahmed that the cost of servicing Nigeriaƒ??s debt has surpassed the Federal Governmentƒ??s retained revenue by N310bn in the first quarter of the year is very worrisome.In a statement, Atiku said, ƒ??First, this action must be in breach of all known reasonable debt-sustainability thresholds. Second, it puts a big question mark on the capacity of the government to manage its rising debt profile without endangering macroeconomic stability. Indeed, I am concerned that this action is already exposing Nigeria to financial stability issues as we slip from a medium risk of debt distress to high risk of debt distress. ƒ??I had on several occasions warned that not only is the fiscal cost of governmentƒ??s indiscriminate borrowing so enormous but has even greater opportunity costs as we sacrifice investments in critical areas, including education, health, and other basic services. This is certainly detrimental to Nigeriaƒ??s long-term growth.ƒ?As a way forward, the PDP candidate recommended what he described as urgent steps the government needed to take address the situation.He said, ƒ??Take immediate steps to slow down the rate of debt accumulation by promoting more Public Private Partnerships in critical infrastructure funding and identifying more innovative funding options.

    "\"Analysts at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise have said that the soaring cost of diesel is expected to accelerate inflationary pressure on the economy to the extent that the recent increase in the price of petrol may not be immediately felt.The PUNCH had reported earlier that Premium Motor Spirit, popularly known as petrol, would now be sold between N170/litre and N190/litre in filling stations across the country, following what is believed to be a subtle agreement between Federal Government officials and oil marketers.The increase follows weeks of scarcity which have led to fare hikes across major cities in the country. During this time, fuel marketers had insisted that it was no longer sustainable to distribute the product at its N165/Litre benchmark and only a price review would fix the supply chain crisis.Speaking on how the hike would affect organised businesses, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, described the decision by the oil marketers and the Federal Government as a necessary compromise that would prevent a complete collapse of the supply chain. Related News We didnƒ??t increase petrol price, marketers did ƒ??FG Fuel price hike: Civil servants want pay rise Firm to unveil diesel delivery app Asked if the new pump price might trigger higher prices in the marketplace, Yusuf said, ƒ??Not necessarily, because, before now, the disruption that had been created by the inability of the marketers to distribute at N165 had already pushed the price above N200. Outside Lagos and Abuja, I can tell you that people are buying fuel for N190, N200 plus. If you compare that to the N180 that is now the benchmark, people are still better off. In terms of the impact on price, I donƒ??t see any considerable adverse effect that this will have compared to when you allow the system to collapse completely.ƒ?Also speaking, the Deputy-President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Gabriel Idahosa, said the inflation that was already being created by the significant increase in prices of diesel and kerosene would naturally eclipse the marginal increase in the price of PMS.He said, ƒ??Because the diesel price has gone so high already, the fuel price increase from N165 to N180 may only reflect in some movements in the general public transportation who use petrol for their vehicles, but in terms of any significant impact on inflation, it will not be there.ƒ?\"\n",

    "\"Amid a projection by the Federal Government to spend a whopping sum of N6.7tn on fuel subsidy next year and a major shortfall in government oil revenue this year, economic and energy experts have predicted tougher days ahead for the economy, states and Nigerians.The Minister of Finance, Zainad Ahmed, had on Thursday released the four-month fiscal report of the economy during a public consultation on the 2023-2025 Medium Term Expenditure Framework/FSP.ƒ??Crude oil production challenges and PMS subsidy deductions by NNPC constitute significant threat to the achievement of our revenue growth targets, as seen in the 2022 Performance up to April,ƒ? Ahmed said.ƒ??Bold, decisive and urgent action is urgently required to address revenue underperformance and expenditure efficiency at national & sub-national levels,ƒ? she noted.Economists and petroleum experts projected that Nigerians, state govts and the economy would experience tougher days ahead going by the numbers.The gross oil and gas federation revenue for the first four months of 2022 failed to meet the expected target, falling from N3.12 trillion to N1.23 trillion, representing a 39 per cent performance, according to the Overview of 2022 Fiscal Outcomes and Update on 2022 Federation Revenue Performance presented by the finance minister.Ahmed said the subsidy projection was based on business-as-usual or reform scenarios, noting that the first scenario assumed that subsidy would be retained and fully provided for. The second scenario, she said, assumed that subsidy would remain up till mid-2023 based on the 18-month extension earlier announced, but only N3.36 trillion would be spent.Both scenarios, however, contained opportunity costs in relation to net accretion to the federation account and deficit, she noted.She said despite higher oil prices, oil revenue underperformed due to significant oil production shortfalls arising from oil production shut-ins resulting from pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft; and high petrol subsidy cost due to higher landing costs of imported products.She further said that the amount available for distribution from the Federation Account was N1.52 trillion within the first four months of the year.Of this amount, she said, the Federal Government received N802.50 billion, while? states and local governments got N407.04 billion and N313.81 billion respectively.ƒ??Federal, State and Local governments received N107.67 billion, N358.90 billion and N251.23 billion respectively from the VAT Pool Account.ƒ?She said as of April 2022, FGNƒ??s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49 per cent of the prorata target of N3.32? trillion. She said the Customs collections (made up of import duties, excise and fees, as well as federation account special levies) trailed target by N76.77 billion (25.42 per cent).ƒ??In the MTEF, real GDP growth is projected at 3.75% in 2023, from a revised projection of 3.55% for 2022. Growth is expected to moderate to 3.30% in 2024 before picking up to 3.46% in 2025,ƒ? she said.On the other hand, inflation rate is projected to average 17.16 per cent in 2023, up from the revised average of 16.11 per cent for 2022, she said.ƒ??Upward pressure on prices is expected to be driven by the current and lag effect of the global price surge due to the Russian-Ukraine war, domestic insecurity, rising costs of imports, exchange rate depreciation, as well as other supply-side constraints.ƒ?She said overall, fiscal risks were somewhat elevated, following weaker-than-expected domestic economic performance and structural issues in the domestic economy.Ahmed noted that revenue generation remained the major fiscal constraint of the Federation, stressing that the systemic resource mobilisation problem had been compounded by recent economic recessions.Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Chinyere Almona, in a recent statement, said Nigeria must identify corporate, physical, intangible, human assets, determine their worth, and make plans to repurpose or redevelop idle ones. Almona stressed the need to break government monopoly in the infrastructure sector (railway, pipelines, power transmission) in order to attract investors to commit equity funds into them.Experts predictA former Chairman of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria and Managing Director/CEO of 11Plc, Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, said, said the development would worsen the economy.He said,? ƒ??Life would obviously be tougher for Nigerians. One of the things in the report also said we are now spending more on debt servicing than we are getting as revenue. You donƒ??t need a rocket science because if that was a company or an individual, you will be extremely worried about that personƒ??s financial status. So, itƒ??s the same thing with the country.? ƒ??NNPC can still fund subsidies on behalf of the federal government. Only that government will be a client and they will have agreement, there will be terms and conditions . Itƒ??s just that unlike before, the NNPC was just funding subsidies, now, it has to be done on a contract basis , and the federal government will pay for its services. Itƒ??s definitely not a good thing to use all revenue to service debts, and those debts are coming from subsidies. Itƒ??s a potential danger for the country.He added, ƒ??My worry is that what we were avoiding- the suffering and inflation that we were avoiding by not removing the subsidy will now be worse, because if we get to a point where we find it difficult to service our debts, what it means is that our lenders will charge us more interests because they know we donƒ??t have money. Their interest will be much higher, with less revenue to pay salaries. So, from a financial standpoint, itƒ??s not good news for Nigeria.ƒ?On his part, an economic expert and seasoned academic at the University of Uyo, Professor Akpan Ekpo said government would face an uphill task sourcing money to fund the proposed subsidy. Ekpo said, ƒ??Itƒ??s a tall order. The NNPC being privatised is, as you know, they will pay dividend to shareholders, which is still the government in a way. Itƒ??s just that it wonƒ??t feature in the monthly sharing formula; but eventually, some money will go to the Federal Government because they will pay dividend to the Federal Government.ƒ??This is why we have been saying that this subsidy thing is very unfortunate. Firstly, if the refineries were working, at least we would have produced for the domestic market. All our forex is used to import refined products. Maybe they may have to rearrange their priorities and cut down on expenditure. They should do what economists call expenditure switching.ƒ??They can remove subsidy gradually, but not in one swoop. Definitely, itƒ??s a tall order. I hope they donƒ??t resort to borrowing to pay for subsidy because that will be dangerous.ƒ? Related News Notore records N26bn half-year revenue Inflation: Civil servants seek salary increase Surviving in a period of inflation He added that states would have to create structures that will enable them to boost internally generated revenue as the proposed fuel subsidy would inevitably gulp a significant fraction of funds which would otherwise be allocated to State and Local Governments.An economic expert at the Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, Dr Olusegun Vincent said, ƒ??It doesnƒ??t mean well for Nigerians at all, to be spending so much on fuel subsidy. There is lack of transparency around the subsidy regime and the system that governs subsidy in the country. There is a whole lot of economic inefficiencies.ƒ?The scholar also criticised governmentƒ??s worrisome debt profile, noting that ƒ??it is unsustainable and we are all going to suffer.ƒ?He added, ƒ??Currently, the total amount of government spending on debt servicing is actually more than the total revenue of the government. That constitutes part of expenditure. When you add subsidy to that, clearly we are headed towards a major problem. Also speaking, Professor Sheriffdeen Tella of Onabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun, said subsidy had been one of the tools which the present government has used to ruin Nigeriaƒ??s economy.Tella further queried the source from which the Federal Government would raise the funds.He said, ƒ??Where did the NNPC get the money from? The money is supposed to be part of the federal allocation. What they have simply done is to use our commonwealth for those in the NNPC. They have been spending the Federal Government money as if it were their private money. NNPC is one of those organizations that donƒ??t give account of their budgets for approval by the national assembly.ƒ?States, FG The Chairman Forum of Commissioners of Finance and Benue State Finance Commissioner, David Olofu has berated Federal Government for proposing N6.7tn to petroleum subsidy in 2023.Speaking on the phone with one of our correspondents on Thursday, Olofu regretted that the arm of government responsible for checking the executive excesses had for a long time abandoned itƒ??s oversight functions.The finance forum boss asked rhetorically if the money is to be used for forthcoming elections by the APC-led government, stating that such an amount would not only cripple states but also the federal government. He said, ƒ??That is election money the Federal Government is looking for, or else, how can they say they want to spend N6.7 trillion on subsidy. It shows that Nigeria is sick and need blood transfusionƒ??There are elected officers at every level of government from local, State and federal in the country and we have 360 House of Representatives and 109 senators who are saddled with the responsibility of checking the expenditure of the federal government.ƒ??Are they not having oversight function over federal institutions and if they do not see anything wrong with the subsidy payment of N6.7 trillion. ƒ??In a country where we have over 80 million people living in abject poverty, then, we need to rethink the type of democracy we are practicing,? because, democracy guarantees check and balance and if our democracy can not guarantee this, it does not worth it.Olofu added, ƒ??Do you know no of kilometers of roads, railway lines and waterways N6.7 trillion can construct? How much is it to dredge river Benue and Niger and build ports along down to coastal region of this country?ƒ??In other countries what they do to develop other sectors is to make sure that the three major means of transportation are fully developed.ƒ?Olofu, who said that the nation path to growth would continue to be a mirage as long as federal government neglect itƒ??s infrastructure to, adding that if the nation can expend a trillion naira on infrastructure, ƒ?? there will be a great turn aroundƒ?.While he stated that petroleum subsidy was not sustainable, Olofu said that both states and federal government would be crippled by payment of such huge amount on subsidy. ƒ??It is not only going to cripple states but also the federal government, it so, everybody is in a deep mess. It is just that federal government has the latitude, I mean multiple options available to it, so it is difficult to notice.ƒ??It is just like a fat man, when fat man is hungry you wonƒ??t know because he is fat. Federal government is also suffering from what is happening in the country,ƒ? Olofu saiNACCIMA fearsThe Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture has urged economic policymakers to take urgent actions with regard to fixing Nigeriaƒ??s economic challenges to prevent the economy from sliding into recession.ƒ??NACCIMA President, John Udeagbala, stated this on Thursday during the Chamberƒ??s state of the economy press conference in Lagos.The Chamber noted that the economy had now surpassed the highest rate of inflation ever recorded of 18.17 per cent in March 2021.According to Udeagbala, the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria was of major concern to the Organised Private Sector, considering that the 33.3 per cent rate of unemployment often quoted, was a statistic that was two years old and did not take into full consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Europe on the Nigerian labour market.He said, ƒ??Ladies and Gentlemen, to provide some context, we start this briefing by expressing our grave concern about the state of the economy as we acknowledge the positive growth statistics published by the National Bureau of Statistics for the Second Quarter of the year, 2022. ƒ??Our concern is based on the possible false sense of security that this statistic may create, as the second quarter of 2022 may not fully capture the supply and value chain disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.ƒ??We, therefore once again, urge policymakers to take urgent action to avoid economic recession.ƒ?On Nigeriaƒ??s growing debt profile, Udeagbala said it was now very obvious that the current levels of debt were unsustainable, as the International Monetary Fund projected that by 2026, all of Nigeriaƒ??s revenue would go to servicing debt.ƒ??As we consider that the National budget is heavily skewed towards recurrent expenditure that is largely unmet by the estimated government revenue, we counsel all levels of government to consider other sources of funding, such as leveraging public-private-partnerships for tax credits spread over time. The economy cannot run based on increasing the number of taxes borne by the private sector, as we have witnessed by recent laws passed by the National Assembly, and we advocate policies that systematically and consistently increase the tax base in terms of the volume of production or the number of taxpayers.ƒ?The NACCIMA president further stated that the power sector was of keen interest to the private sector as it was continually plagued by grid collapse resulting in the instability of power generation, distribution and supply. The alternative source of energy obtained from the oil and gas sector, he said, represented a significant portion of production costs for the private sector.He added that the impact of the electioneering processes on the Nigerian business community was key and significant for the growth of the economy and that the association would ensure that it engaged candidates at all levels and would organise policy dialogue meetings to discuss the challenges facing the business community and obtain their positions on these matters.\"\n",

Adebayo Adeleke, said, ƒ??They need to have a balanced portfolio and part of the balanced portfolio should speak to liquidity because when the pensioners come calling to collect some or all of their money as the case may be, the Pension Fund Administrators should be able to access money within a very short time to be able to pay.ƒ??If they have some form of funds in very liquid form, that is placements in banks or fixed deposit or very short term money instruments, it should have given them the opportunity to meet their obligations if and when some pension payments are due.ƒ?\"\n",
